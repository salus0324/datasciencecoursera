babs
i
don
t
know
maybe
they
re
getting
too
much
sun
i
think
i
m
going
to
cut
them
way
back
i
replied
the
reason
could
be
anything
maybe
you
violated
some
arcane
meaningless
regulation
among
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
pages
of
us
code
ignorance
of
the
law
is
not
an
excuse
maybe
you
were
at
the
wrong
place
at
the
wrong
time
or
maybe
they
had
no
real
reason
at
all
other
than
mere
suspicion
last
but
certainly
far
from
least
i
want
to
talk
about
the
magnetic
triggers
that
was
mentioned
yesterday
i
had
seen
for
a
couple
of
weeks
various
people
just
waking
up
one
day
and
walking
out
of
their
lives
i
had
not
talked
about
it
because
it
was
really
strange
it
looked
almost
zombie
like
blank
stares
just
leaving
i
had
no
clue
where
they
were
going
i
was
too
transfixed
on
the
blank
expressions
some
even
had
older
children
along
side
of
them
equally
with
the
same
blank
look
on
their
face
i
am
sure
if
i
had
really
looked
at
the
expression
on
my
own
face
as
i
moved
out
of
my
family
s
life
to
new
mexico
i
would
have
looked
the
same
had
no
clue
why
i
was
doing
it
or
what
would
happen
i
just
had
to
go
i
am
more
than
grateful
that
i
did
josef
strauss
delirien
waltz
please
contribute
not
with
money
but
with
your
spare
time
to
give
to
those
that
really
are
in
need
of
help
you
can
do
this
by
simply
making
your
voice
heard
and
forcing
your
own
goverments
to
take
notice
bolus
i
am
in
the
market
for
a
great
stamp
for
the
back
of
my
cards
i
think
i
would
like
to
have
my
name
and
blog
site
listed
and
i
think
a
bit
of
a
crazy
font
would
make
it
just
about
perfect
for
my
style
any
ideas
hey
and
what
about
watermarks
what
do
you
use
on
your
pics
sister
mallory
castle
you
have
a
letter
they
are
stuck
in
a
class
i
prefer
to
call
the
very
next
day
she
of
course
had
to
go
to
work
we
have
been
keeping
the
curtains
closed
on
the
patio
door
for
a
reason
one
which
she
can
not
seem
to
comprehend
this
is
not
an
invitation
for
her
or
anyone
to
come
up
on
my
patio
and
bang
on
the
glass
door
and
yet
she
does
it
anyway
this
time
she
had
gone
in
the
house
to
change
and
take
out
her
trash
first
so
she
was
already
wearing
her
nightgown
and
had
taken
out
her
bottom
teeth
i
almost
did
not
answer
it
she
knows
we
do
not
like
it
when
she
does
this
if
i
have
the
curtains
closed
it
is
typically
because
i
am
not
dressed
appropriately
just
because
she
is
comfortable
coming
in
my
house
in
front
of
my
husband
in
her
nightgown
does
not
mean
i
want
other
people
to
see
me
in
mine
she
has
to
walk
past
my
inside
front
door
to
get
to
her
own
anyway
it
boggles
my
mind
what
seemed
to
be
an
unprecedented
rebellion
of
matter
itself
against
natural
law
was
not
really
anything
outrageous
or
new
but
only
part
of
the
natural
course
of
things
still
there
is
sense
that
for
the
poet
something
new
has
happened
there
was
a
subtle
flood
of
steam
moving
upon
the
face
of
things
for
him
the
face
of
things
his
perceptual
experience
of
the
world
has
been
changed
in
a
way
that
though
subtle
is
deeply
important
this
movement
of
the
steam
has
been
a
flood
and
even
more
biblically
it
has
moved
upon
the
face
of
things
just
as
the
spirit
of
moved
upon
the
face
of
the
waters
in
the
act
that
began
creation
outside
of
betty
page
videos
it
was
pulp
fiction
what
started
it
all
with
ving
rhames
bruce
willis
and
a
gimp
it
is
a
remarkable
scene
it
takes
pulp
fiction
in
directions
anew
and
would
be
endlessly
ripped
off
and
homaged
for
years
to
come
it
catapulted
the
ball
gag
into
the
mainstream
for
want
of
a
better
word
i
hesitate
to
call
pulp
fiction's
indie
crime
thriller
properly
mainstream
still
pulp
fiction
spoofs
aside
all
was
quiet
for
the
ball
gag
for
a
good
few
years
sure
it
popped
up
in
the
likes
of
the
simpsons
and
the
occasional
horror
flick
namely
like
candyman
3
but
hollywood
was
not
too
sure
what
to
do
with
it
just
yet
lyla
garrity
minka
kelly
cheerleader
and
girlfriend
to
starting
quarterback
jason
street
she
s
portrayed
as
being
the
good
girl
type
who
tries
to
do
right
by
everyone
and
everything
however
the
more
i
stared
at
our
closest
natural
satellite
an
odd
sense
of
wrongness
overcame
me
something
and
i
was
hard
pressed
to
put
my
foot
on
it
was
wrong
with
what
i
was
seeing
it
s
possible
that
some
will
take
some
time
getting
into
it
she
loved
to
talk
about
her
children
but
never
talked
about
her
husband
or
their
relationship
henry
said
in
a
telephone
interview
from
italy
it
never
seemed
like
a
very
close
relationship
but
i
never
saw
anything
that
indicated
she
might
be
in
danger
nothing
to
make
me
worry
about
her
the
atlanta
journal
constitution
reported
that
zinkhan
dumped
his
jeep
passport
inside
sounds
weird
i
say
i
posted
this
pic
yesterday
and
some
of
you
thought
i
had
a
double
lot
hilarious
yes
darling
we
could
not
decide
which
pool
we
liked
so
we
built
two
actually
our
neighbors
were
so
excited
about
fence
me
in
and
their
stellar
work
they
are
getting
a
new
fence
at
the
same
time
and
i
go
back
to
work
monday
of
the
barrow
the
sad
part
is
this
50
of
the
time
the
customer
bought
the
white
doll
instead
of
leaving
empty
handed
i
asked
the
manager
why
the
number
of
black
and
hispanic
dolls
was
so
limited
and
the
reply
shocked
me
sometimes
i
wonder
if
these
organised
humans
are
the
same
species
as
me
they
obviously
understand
something
i
don
t
and
have
probably
made
a
note
of
it
in
one
of
their
thousands
of
notebooks
every
now
and
again
i
try
to
copy
them
to
mimic
their
behaviour
in
the
hopes
that
i
will
assimilate
into
their
culture
but
i
m
obviously
missing
something
important
though
i
buy
calendars
and
make
notes
it
never
seems
to
culminate
in
me
being
organised
it
s
just
more
pieces
of
paper
for
me
to
lose
in
the
pile
of
things
that
are
very
probably
important
as
a
postscript
to
my
last
entry
here
at
cinedrome
i
have
just
learned
that
cinemark
holdings
inc
is
presenting
one
night
only
screenings
of
wings
this
month
as
part
of
their
reel
classics
series
there
were
two
of
them
scheduled
but
the
first
one
on
may
2
was
over
before
i
knew
about
it
that
leaves
one
more
on
wednesday
may
16
go
here
on
the
cinemark
web
site
and
click
on
the
wings
reel
classics
box
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
to
see
if
there
is
a
participating
cinemark
theater
near
you
if
there
is
you
will
find
it
well
worth
your
while
i
m
also
tired
of
waiting
on
biblegateway
to
load
the
page
for
me
to
provide
the
link
and
what
more
it
makes
for
bad
devotion
from
here
on
out
i
ll
be
posting
a
link
to
the
whole
of
matthew
3
at
the
top
of
the
page
where
the
chapter
title
is
some
of
the
links
are
present
below
but
they
cut
out
toward
the
end
some
may
know
extraneous
details
but
just
she
and
i
know
what
happened
i
think
at
this
point
actually
i
m
the
only
one
that
knows
why
i
chose
this
book
see
above
but
also
because
i
am
from
wisconsin
and
enjoy
learning
about
the
history
of
our
fishing
communities
and
immigrant
experiences
and
also
because
it
is
friday
of
earth
week
i
love
sharing
great
stories
for
kids
about
our
natural
world
the
second
disc
includes
lumet
on
lumet
a
collection
of
archival
interviews
with
the
director
who
talks
about
his
long
career
he
talks
about
getting
into
show
business
as
a
kid
he
also
discusses
his
work
ethic
and
how
he
applied
it
to
his
films
lumet
also
shares
some
of
his
interesting
life
experiences

abbreviation
for

indiana
which
is
located
in
lawrenceburg

just
west
of
cincinnati
for
a
discussion
of
the
chances
of
james
murdoch
and
david
cameron
follow
the
links
on
their
names
it
would
probably
be
fair
to
say
that
the
latter
s
performance
in
the
house
today
improved
his
chances
somewhat
but
that
as
ever
they
depend
on
what
else
emerges
as
time
goes
on
imagine
coming
to
a
comedy
club
and
not
being
sure
if
the
comedian
was
david

or
ricky
gervais
analyzed
peter
ignorance
as
well
as
disapproval
for
the
natural
restraints
placed
on
market
excesses
that
capitalism
and
sound
markets
impose
cause
our
present
leaders
to
reject
capitalism
and
blame
it
for
all
the
problems
we
face
if
this
fallacy
is
not
corrected
and
capitalism
is
even
further
undermined
the
prosperity
that
the
free
market
generates
will
be
destroyed
much
much
more
in
my
next
article
on
this
subject
praying
as
jesus
prayed
part
2
i
will
comment
on
the
remaining
two
themes
on
prayer
at
the
beginning
of

other

stamped
with
would
it
be
any
different
if
i
opened
a
store
and
took
my
proceeds
and
spent
it
on
a

is
asking
people
to
buy
something
from
me
so
that
i
can
get
my

fine
and
hey
ivan
why
do
not
you
buy
some
of
our
lovely
smack
while
you
are
here
oh
our
other
spot
here
at
senator
wash
was
probably
a
scorpion
nursery
remember
a
large
arizona
barker
scorpion
ran
past
our
lawn
chairs
well
there
was
a
baby
one
by
our
back
rv
jacks
equal
amount
of
venom
none
have
been
seen
at
the
new
location
whew
one
of
the
things
which
turned
me
off
about
many
republicans
when
i
was
younger
is
their
ebenezer
scrooge
like
attitude
towards
their
fellow
man
perhaps
this
is
a
result
of
liberals
trying
to
force
charity
out
of
their
fellow
citizens
trying
to
coerce
people
to
 
love
their
neighbor
 
of
course
the
liberal
is
wrong
to
do
this
charity
is
not
charity
if
it
is
compulsory
or
coerced
but
just
because
liberals
use
 
compassion
 
as
an
excuse
for
extorting
money
from
the
rest
of
us
from
the
productive
that
does
not
make
charity
a
bad
thing
or
compassion
a
weakness
it
can
be
exploited
but
only
if
we
let
it
i
gravitate
toward
novels
about
india
this
year
alone
i
have
read
four
of
them
and
although
that
is
certainly
not
enough
to
make
me
anything
but
a
dilettante
still
it
is
more
than
most
people
i
know
nostalgia
1

if
you
have
stopped
painting
for
some
times
and
you
feel
down
because
of
it
the
best
way
out
is
not
to
ask
yourself
why
but
just
to
take
small
steps
to
get
back
into
it
artists
are
makers
and
it

bleamy's
corner
follows
the
life
and
wanderings
of
eleven
year
old
jeromy
bleamy
a
mostly
wise
sometimes
precocious
and
often
proud
child
who
is
full
of
what
he
would
call
unshakeable
resolve
and
what
others
would
call
courageous
stubbornness
when
i
was
in
high
school
i
also
had
a
reputation
and
it
was
not
a
very
good
one
by
many
standards
in
past
years
i
ve
just
escalated
feed
in
the
last
30
days
of
pregnancy
leading
up
to
the
first
day
lambs
are
due
this
time
i
started
ramping
them
up
on
grain
ten
weeks
prior
to
lambing
bringing
them
up
to
1
5
lbs
per
head
per
day
over
three
weeks
so
they
had
seven
full
weeks
of
high
grain
before
the
onset
of
lambing
and
more
if
they
lambed
later
than
the
first
day
i
used
a
dry
rolled
corn
barley
mix
no
molasses
which
is
only
about
10
protein
same
as
my
hay
so
it
s
not
a
hot
feed
like
soybean
meal
which
is
about
50
protein
rather
it
is
just
something
to
give
them
extra
calories
as
they
are
able
to
take
in
less
feed
volume
when
their
bellies
are
full
of
lambs
capitalism
is
based
on
playing
to
your
individual
strengths
not
everyone
is
good
at
math
and
so
not
everyone
is
an
engineer
the
same
analogy
works
with
history
curator
politics
lobbyist
science
microbiologist
based
off
the
three
examples
i
just
gave
you
here
s
how
capitalism
works
a
student
tries
hard
in
school
and
wins
a
merit
scholarship
for
the
university
she
wants
to
attend
which
was
designed
by
an
engineer
working
with
an
architect
she
s
got
her
mind
set
on
having
her
own
research
firm
when
she
graduates
so
she
works
a
job
to
earn
money
for
her
future
instead
of
getting
and
doing
nothing
all
day
after
she
graduates
she
sets
out
with
her
money
and
starts
a
firm
with
her
friends
eventually
they
all
go
on
a
diving
trip
to
discover
why
some
tuna
are
dying
like
never
before
let
s
say
that
they
find
and
bring
back
some
water
samples
to
their
firm
s
lab
they
find
a
new
parasite
that
is
killing
the
profitable
tuna
they
then
publish
their
findings
and
appeal
to
a
lobbyist
to
find
a
solution
within
congress
when
a
solution
is
found
and
the
crisis
is
resolved
she
ends
up
having
her
picture
in
a
museum
that
the
curator
is
in
charge
of
that
s
capitalism
conservative
ideals
of
working
hard
keeping
earned
money
and
individualism
all
support
capitalism
aka
our
system
access
to
the
latest
cricut
com
deals
having
recently
moved
back
to
south
africa
from
niger
i
am
perplexed
by
all
the
racism
in
this
country
we
left
during
apartheid
i
came
back
because
there
is
not
much
economic
wise
positive
in
niger
rationally
and
objectively
there
are
only
plusses
to
being
afforded
the
opportunity
to
leave
south
africa
the
facts
about
south
africa
i
ve
documented
in
many
essays
these
facts
oddly
enough
are
not
always
known
processed
or
understood
by
south
africans
i
have
noticed
something
in
temescal
recently
hats
lots
of
hats
lots
of
different
kinds
of
hats
and
especially
lots
of
weird
hats
it
frustrates
me
then
when
activists
in
search
of
a
cause
in
my
experience
often
frizzy
haired
academics
use
cultural
boycotts
to
disperse
an
inaccurate
 
them
and
us
 
mentality
that
inhibits
any
relationship
between
the
communities
sue
blackwell
an
enthusiastic
supporter
of
a
boycott
of
israel
is
one
example
she
was
also
my
frizzy
haired
university
tutor
this
will
be
my
last
daily
post
i
am
going
to
switch
to
weekly
posts
the
work
with
remington
is
going
to
be
a
lot
more
repetitive
and
i'd
hate
to
be
posting
the
same
thing
everyday
you
dress
funny
cardigan
modstr
m
tirosh
becker
also
publishes
a
large
number
of
quotations
from
the
previously
lost
mekhilta
of
rabbi
shimon
b
yohai
this
is
a
real
find
and
the
author
promises
an
article
soon
with
menahem
kahana
on
their
value
see
pp
112
115
for
a
discussion
and
pp
856
882
for
the
quotations
there
is
a
disproportionately
large
amount
of
quotations
from
this
mekhilta
in
the
corpus
pointing
to
its
prominence
in
babylonia
indeed
the
mekhilta
of
rabbi
ishmael
was
sometimes
called
the
palestinian
mekhilta
many
of
these
quotations
are
from
parts
of
the
mekhilta
not
attested
in
known
genizah
fragments
and
were
reconstructed
from
the
fourteenth
century
yemenite
midrash
hagadol
twice
by
d
z
hoffmann
and
by
j
n
epstein
the
latter
was
more
conservative
in
his
reconstructions
but
several
quotations
discovered
by
tirosh
becker
actually
support
hoffmann
s
more
extensive
reconstructions
however
these
quotations
as
far
as
i
could
see
are
not
marked
in
any
way
as
derived
from
the
mekhilta
and
in
some
cases

i
m
curious
why
the
author
thinks
they
are
from
this
work
and
not
simply
from
one
of
the
talmuds
which
contain
similar
material
moving
the
furniture
was
near
impossible
and
even
though
i
live
with
my
brother
and
nephew
and
niece
i
would
not
think
of
asking
for
help
see
a
trend
here
there
was
no
place
to
put
anything
in
my
living
room
so
i
moved
things
mostly
filled
rather
than
unloading
everything
those
ikea
shelves
weigh
a
ton
when
loaded
and
do
not
like
to
be
moved
and
those
old
tables
well
they
are
great
cause
the
tops
are
enameled
and
can
be
scraped
with
a
razor
blade
but
the
legs
are
all
wobbly
and
the
leaves
want
to
fall
off
and
the
floor
is
way
crooked
so
i
shimmied
and
shoved
and
grunted
and
groaned
till
they
were
in
place
then
i
took
tylenol
and
slept
in
the
recliner
till
my
knees
wanted
to
work
again
this
is
an
update
to
this
post
from
what
i
learned
about
how
public
schools
handle
bullying
the
right
thing
to
do
is
always
to
tell
an
adult
but
it
s
not
generally
going
to
do
any
good
there
are
certain
kinds
of
people
whose
lives
are
just
plain
worth
less
to
everyone
else
and
members
of
those
groups
always
learn
where
they
stand
sooner
or
later
me
i
know
my
tummy
is
just
full
from
dinner
and
i
do
not
want
to
catch
your
cold
what
a
mesh
41
so
i
heard
you
got
the
hots
for
me
there
comes
a
point
where
the
world
is
surreal
and
i
was
beyond
anger
raw
veggies
green
pepper
capsicum
onion
cilantro
carrot
spinach
in
a
world
with
wonders
undefined
the
place
was
empty
there
was
only
a
family
with
a
young
boy
and
a
baby
that
didn
t
want
to
stop
crying
nevertheless
we
went
in
the
ambiance
was
very
date
friendly
the
tables
a
little
to
close
for
comfort
but
you
do
what
you
gotta
do
to
make
a
buck
right
each
year
i
spend
the
weeks
before
the
big
day
baking
up
sweet
and
savory
delights
and
this
year
is
no
exception
on
the
list
today
is
christmas
sandwich
cremes
butterscotch
icebox
cookies
and
browned
butter
sugar
cookies
i
usually
bake
about
6
10
different
types
of
cookies
homemade
nut's
and
bolt's
not
exactly
a
baked
good
but
worth
a
mention
as
it
is
sooo
buttery
delish
and
many
other
delicious
bites
and
i
know
that
day
will
come
but
knowing
that
day
is
not
now
can
hurt
a
little
anchor

i
raise

i
am
not

all
he

besides

hi
heather
thanks
for
participating
in
my
first
ever
blogoversary
if
you
opt
against
a
religious
ceremony
you
have
more
freedom
with
who
you
choose
to
officiate
the
best
way
to
save
money
is
to
have
a
friend
perform
the
ceremony
one
of
my
friends
asked
her
uncle
to
officiate
her
wedding
there
s
a
few
ways
to
get
certified
there
are
some
denominations
such
as
the
universal
life
church
and
first
nation
ministry
that
open
ordination
to
anyone
and
allow
you
to
get
certified
online
if
you
choose
to
go
this
route
make
sure
you
check
the
legal
requirements
of
your
state
it
is
nearly
impossible
to
engender
the
necessary
confidence
trust
and
loyalty
a
leader
must
possess
without
being
fully
engaged
a
leader
spends
as
much
time
out
of
the
confines
of
the
office
engaging
in
real
conversation
with
people
as
they
do
in
their
office
planning
decision
making
and
organizing
whether
in
person
over
the
phone
via
email
through
the
social
web
or
even
by
sending
a
good
old
fashion
thank
you

engaging
conversationalist

susie
susie
susie
what
am
i
going
to
do
with
you
i
need
dresses
i
never
had
many
they
are
too
expensive
and
i
always
thought
you
can
t
wear
a
dress
as
often
as
you
can
separate
bottom
and
top
pieces
which
you
combine
to
create
different
looks
so
i
never
wanted
to
spend
so
much
money
on
dresses
but
i
do
love
them
and
now
that
i
can
make
them
exactly
how
i
want
them
i
want
to
have
several
the
first
problem
is
that
ocean
currents
do
not
behave
the
way
warmists
want
there
is
nothing
steady
about
them
it
is
true
that
several
la
nina
cooling
events
have
happened
in
recent
times
but
they
alternated
with
neutral
and
warming
el
nino
events
fear
not
however
with
statistical
averages
we
can
maybe
smooth
that
out
and
so
to
the
article
below
the
interoperability
and
compatibility
issue
is
key
and
a
major
obstacle
is
the
lack
of
a
common
language
and
agreed
operational
standards
for
expressing
identifying
and
communicating
rights
information
both
across
industry
sectors
and
across
national
borders

widely

to
be

in

they
are
quite

and
tasty
but
be
prepared

for

and

best
you
know
how
you
always
hear
parents
talking
about
how
they
finally
get
to
go
out
on
a
date
without
their
kids
but
then
all
they
end
up
talking
about
is
the
kids
i
knew
we'd
miss
kaylee
and
of
course
we'd
think
about
her
and
talk
about
her
but
what
i
did
not
realize
was
the
little
things
during
our
trip
that
would
bring
her
to
mind
as
i
unpacked
and
throughout
our
trip
i
found
things
may
highlights
what
s
a
girl
to
do
i
grabbed
my
computer
bag
ready
to
do
battle
with
the
bulge
with
great
fear
and
trepidation
i
grabbed
the
bag
opened
it
and
was
shocked
to
see
it
didn
t
need
cleaned
out
on
this
particular
trip
i
was
on
my
way
back
from
the
grocery
store
and
all
kinds
of
thoughts
were
going
through
my
head
where
should
i
transplant
my
very
shaky
roots
how
am
i
going
to
survive
financially
are
my
kids
going
to
be
all
right
am
i
going
to
be
all
right
should
i
switch
jobs
and
if
so
what
should
i
do
i
m
a
creature
of
habit
and
don
t
handle
change
well
now
every
aspect
of
my
life
was
up
for
grabs
and
i
was
grasping
into
air
that
seemed
to
be
growing
thinner
by
the
minute
in
fact
aside
from
the
first
chapter
s
colour
pages
the
last
chapter
s
one
colour
page
the
animated
adaptations
i
mentioned
volume
covers
and
some
side
material
this
is
the
only
piece
of
colour
artwork
the
series
has
gotten
despite
the
really
high
quality
drawings
akamatsu
has
given
us
now
onto
some
things
that
did
not
impress
me
about
the
service
this
month
firstly
the
boxes
shipped
out
2
days
later
than
it
was
stated
on
the
sample
society
website
but
they
did
apologize
about
the
delay
when
they
emailed
the
shipping
confirmation
also
before
i
got
my
shipping
confirmation
i
received
a
random
automated
email
listing
all
the
samples
i
was
going
to
get
what
a
spoiler
fortunately
i
averted
my
eyes
just
in
time
and
still
had
my
element
of
surprise
when
i
was
unboxing
the
package
thirdly
the
dermalogica
sample
spilt
all
over
my
box
and
the
powder
got
everywhere
but
i
guess
those
things
happen
and
lastly
i
believe
wa
residents
actually
have
to
pay
another
dollar
for
sales
tax
which
is
a
bit
unfair
that
would
never
leave
a
dry
eye
in
the
room
i
don
t
know
honestly
there
s
just
something
so
alluring
about
having
the
one
thing
you
re
not
supposed
to
have
even
if
we
know
it
s
not
good
for
us
human
nature
i
guess
and
it
s
also
the
ultimate
romantic
notion
loving
someone
against
all
odds
of
our
young
quest
for
fortunate
fruition
and
mike
remains
the
same
as
always
cute
and
playful
woops
that
was
the
dog
mike
did
no
shave
november
and
this
is
him
finally
shaving
it
off
bit
by
bit
there
was
much
rejoicing
on
my
side
but
i
think
his
face
misses
the
warmth
also
recommend
reading
the
novel
with
the
same
name
by
susan
hill
all
done
for
now
i
really
want
to
post
a
recipe
roundup
tomorrow
with
all
my
favorite
pinterest
recipes
we
will
see
if
i
can
get
to
it
after
that
i
will
be
mia
for
a
bit
and
then
i
am
thinking
there
will
be
a
post
with
possibly
even
more
pictures
than
this
one
fun
times
ahead
ice
storm
this
morning
fell
on
my
on
the
ice
in
the
driveway
putting
down
salt
hurt
like
heck
the
wife
laughed
for
one
hour
which
i
think
was
very
cruel
definitely
worth
sparing
the
time
my
glitter
is
not
going
anywhere
we
decided
to
further
analyze
the
genomic
sequence
of
the
mulv
like
contaminant
virus
surprisingly
it
showed
99
identity
to
a
synthetic
retrovirus
which
was
engineered
in
the
1980s
i
let
out
the
most
heartwrenching
wail
as
he
held
me
in
his
arms
that
night
and
i
was
numb
the
next
morning
i
took
off
my
ring
put
it
in
its
box
and
went
to
work
feeling
completely
hollowed
out
if
you
compare
yourself
with
others
there
are
several
reasons
why
i
am
stepping
back
now
let's
call
it
an
indefinite
hiatus
and
chief
among
them
are
that
i
am
trying
to
explore
more
interests
for
which
i
have
not
made
enough
time
over
the
last
few
years
i
used
to
hike
to
the
top
of
a
mountain
every
week
or
two
but
i
have
not
done
that
in
a
few
years
now
i
used
to
travel
a
lot
more
and
i
always
wished
that
i
could
chronicle
those
travels
better
than
just
writing
yelp
reviews
of
the
places
where
we
ate
i
just
happened
to
find
a
perfectly
functional
polaroid
sx
70
at
an
estate
sale
so
now
i
am
excited
to
get
started
on
doing
that
also
i'd
like
to
have
a
band
that
lasts
longer
than
1
2
shows
or
7
8
practices
maybe
record
something
make
a
record
perhaps
start
a
label
not
sure
about
that
last
part
but
we
will
see
where
this
life
after
kdvs
goes
there
is
also
the
friends
and
family
who
i
did
not
get
to
see
often
enough
because
i
spent
two
nights
per
week
at
kdvs
one
to
do
the
show
another
to
train
the
next
generation
of
new
djs
i
definitely
wanna
spend
more
time
with
them
too
it
must
have
been
an
o
b
e
becasue
i
saw
me
push
his
face
out
of
my
window
did
i
mention
how
useless
my
dog
was
at
this
point
my
other
ancient
dog
who
was
at
no
doubt
at
home
sleeping
in
the
favorite
chair
would
have
taken
off
his
smirking
hairless
face
and
gone
for
his
gnads
next
grabbed
his
sunglasses
throwing
them
off
to
the
side
hoping
to
get
a
chance
to
roll
up
the
window
my
sweet
handsome
talented
husband
helped
me
put
together
finally
we
ventured
out
together
the
currents
pushed
warmly
against
our
toes
and
we
gathered
what
little
we
had
and
moved
away
from
the
big
water
into
the
trees
for
awhile
we
lost
the
sun
under
the
heavy
canopy
but
when
the
branches
thinned
out
we
felt
the
warmth
of
it
again
we
followed
the
sun
for
many
days
and
the
beach
became
a
memory
to
us
the
trees
and
the
long
stretches
of
hard
ground
and
loose
blowing
sand
were
something
we
knew
of
from
long
ago
but
neither
of
us
could
explain
the
feeling
at
night
we
crouched
under
fallen
trees
or
inside
of
jumbled
rocks
i
carried
stones
and
a
sharp
stick
because
wild
things
were
peering
at
us
in
the
darkness
and
pacing
us
throughout
the
day
after
many
days
sorry
complained
and
simply
stopped
she
would
go
no
further
and
i
made
her
a
nest
in
a
hidden
thicket
and
we
stayed
there
until
she
cried
out
and
birthed
a
small
hairy
lump
that
shrieked
madly
then
mewled
when
she
brought
it
to
her
breast
we
stayed
put
for
three
moons
and
i
hunted
in
the
night
spearing
the
small
things
that
were
after
our
meat
and
we
ate
the
branches
of
birth
and
death
had
it
rough
people
did
often
take
offense
to
the
life
agents
who
checked
on
them
but
to
assassinate
one
of
them
was
far
more
rare
than
agents
from
rest
of
the
department
death
agents
got
knocked
off
sometimes
but
their
cases
would
be
taken
up
by
others
while
the
assassin
was
tracked
down
assassins
got
neither
a
year
nor
six
months
to
make
up
for
their
crime
when
they
were
caught
some
confessed
screamed
a
speech
or
two
for
the
media
to
pick
up
about
how
the
world
had
gone
wrong
screamed
all
the
way
to
the
final
door
and
beyond
vicky
d
i
was
going
to
start
a
seperate
page
for
a
more
personal
blogging
area
you
know
more
about
my
life
then
crafting
but
i
decided
why
make
it
a
seperate
page
i
will
just
kind
of
include
it
right
here
on
my
craft
page
i
mean
crafting
is
part
of
my
personal
life
too
so
some
posts
may
contain
only
personal
day
kind
of
stuff
and
others
will
be
crafty
kinds
of
stuff
i
think
you
all
can
handle
that
i
promise
not
to
bore
you
i
thought
i
skipped
dinner
today
no
i
just
had
a
small
meal
of
spicy
chicken
and
rice
which
is
just
great
i
think
i
am
on
a
roll
here
i
don
t
feel
hungry
at
all
and
i
think
updating
this
journal
does
helps
as
i
have
to
make
sure
i
don
t
fail
at
this
the
film
is
sly
and
is
not
more
than
the
basic
idea
a
hollywood
silent
films
star
is
catch
unawares
by
the
advent
of
sound
and
without
understanding
the
revolution
foolishly
insist
to
produce
and
interpret
silent
movies
he
falls
into
financial
ruin
and
distress
psychological
and
existential
but
is
saved
at
the
last
moment
by
a
girl
a
young
diva
of
speaking
singing
screaming
cinema
a
girl
who
has
always
loved
george
valentin
that
is
the
name
of
protagonist
any
resemblance
to
real
persons
like
rodolfo
valentino
is
not
purely
coincidental
when
she
was
an
adoring
spectator
of
his
films
and
now
after
having
saved
george
from
ruin
will
help
him
to
enter
in
the
new
cinema
happy
ending
could
tell
from
the
start
that
the
shin
was
off
so
after
heading
up
amphi
for
about
a
minute
i
turned
around
and
walked
home
if
you
have
not
checked
them
out
you
absolutely
must
for
the
4th
mini
challenged
we
are
to
take
one
of
the
books
we
ve
read
or
are
reading
list
the
main
characters
and
create
a
cast
for
the
movie
to
think
that
playing
live
is
about
just
getting
enough
practice
in
beforehand
and
then
playing
your
songs
one
after
another
until
the
time
is
up
is
for
lack
of
a
better
term
a
mistake
there
is
a
whole
range
of
opportunity
being
wasted
gifts
being
sent
back
it
is
important
to
accept
and
to
take
everything
flopsy
what
are
those
and
we
face
time'd
earlier
and
he
told
me
what
great
of
a
time
he
was
having
happens
i
clean
up
the
take
stock
of
the
situation
and
move
on
in
a
different
way
that
is
all
there
is
really
do
you
have
difficulty
with
disappointments
or
necessary
changes
of
plans
in
life
let
me
know
if
you
wish
keep
well
obviously
the
assassination
has
sparked
some
heated
discussion
in
our
little
house
but
in
this
as
many
things
muslim
we
agree
the
navy
seals
did
a
remarkable
job
executing
this
mission
and
we
are
both
thankful
that
they
did
not
try
to
capture
him
the
media
would
have
all
americans
believe
that
the
moslem
community
is
in
an
uproar
over
his
death
and
armageddon
will
surely
commence
at
this
dire
and
traumatic
news
you
can
see
it
in
my
eyes
make
sure
it
is
set
at
720p
the
room
is
dark
and
no
one
bothers
you
while
you
are
watching
further
up
the
path
i
meet
a
centaur
whom
appears
to
have
an
impressive
amount
of
hair
but
it
is
actually
the
bushy
end
of
his
tail
strategically
placed
to
ensure
i
did
not
mistake
him
for
a
young
boy
i
am
sure
they
did
not
think
of
these
things
when
they
were
doing
the
art
back
in
the
 
80s
agathe
christine
brewer
in
this
case
schoeller's
technique
is
the
perfect
way
to
highlight
the
similarities
and
dissimilarities
of
identical
twins
were
it
not
for
this
descriptive
text
viewers
might
think
that
these
pictures
feature
the
same
person
photographed
twice
on
closer
inspection
however
readers
might
see
small
deviations
a
scar
here
more
freckles
there
a
slightly
upturned
nose
on
one
a
more
prominent
chin
on
the
other
slowly
viewers
realize
that
they
are
looking
at
identical
twins

or

anything
good
happen
this
year
yes
a
few
things
i
finally
got
my
driver
s
license
that
is
the
best
thing
i
did
this
year
second
best
is
learning
to
drive
forklifts
then
i
can
t
think
of
anything
else
i
ve
done
that
has
been
any
good
the
independent
names
mark
reynolds
and
glenn
crann
of
savills
as
joint
receivers
over
the
business
but
they
look
like
property
receivers
to
me
all
the
government
is
doing
is
adding
fuel
to
the
fire
even
with
above
average
academic
performance
the
number
of
scholarships
or
financial
assistance
available
is
negligible
for
a
white
male
i
d
love
to
work
more
hours
and
become
more
independent
from
my
parents
but
that
s
just
not
happening
anytime
soon
hunger
games
before
i
can
even
write
what
i
intended
to
i
am
already
in
tears
i
should
not
be
writing
you
this
letter
you
should
be
here
in
my
arms
snuggled
against
me
right
now
alas
that
is
not
what
the
cards
held
for
me
so
instead
i
write
to
you

you
are

my
next
thought
was
the
washing
of
the
water
as
the
water
lapped
at
my
feet
i
thought
about
the
washing
of
my
spirit
s
washing
taking
all
that
junk
and
washing
it
out
in
the
ocean
burying
it
on
the
ocean
floor
one
of
my
favorite
things
about
movies
is
the
ability
to
transport
us
to
another
place
in
another
time
and
for
some
of
us
the
south
in
the
sixties
is
very
familiar
territory
so
my
 
retirement
 
plan
has
now
gone
from
dying
while
i
can
still
afford
the
high
quality
dog
food
to
hoping
not
to
have
to
sell
a
kidney
to
pay
the
rent
before
i
am
60
and
the
number
one
spot
goes
to
emma
wiggins
from
an
unexpected
bride
this
is
a
particularly
handsome
row
of
houses
i
love
those
domes
which
carry
on
down
the
street
far
beyond
the
frame
of
the
photograph
that
is
very
healthy
for
the
heart
they
actually
have
the
on
friday
we
took
the
kids
to
lansing
to
impression
5
i
went
there
in
middle
school
and
remembered
it
being
a
super
awesome
place
it
is
advertised
as
a
science
center
and
i
just
knew
that
david
and
ryan
would
love
it

ok
then
he
sat
down
he
pulled
out
a
couple
maps
and
started
drawing
on
them
and
circling
campsites
i
move
things
around
alot
in
our
house
i
like
to
switch
things
up
but
now
i
do
not
know
what
to
do
with
this
wall
interleaved
with
his
story
are
two
others
of
a
single
mum
vanessa
paradis
struggling
to
raise
a
son
with
down
syndrome
in
sixties
paris
and
of
a
woman
plagued
by
strange
dreams
sonshine
and
i
started
watching
planet
earth
with
richard
hammond
mother
hates
him
 
why
is
that
little
man
on
everything
 
and
had
to
give
up
near
the
end
with
a
film
about
poaching
elephants
much
worse
than
poaching
eggs
the
tears
and
snotters
started
with
the
first
appearance
of
the
starving
little
lion
cup
got
progressively
louder
and
hotter
at
the
shivering
little
black
bears
up
a
tree
in
north
america
somewhere
and
when
the
elephant
calf
disappeared
the
overall
face
wetness
became
overwhelming
and
sonshine
found
it
distressing
too
this
is
just
for
you
to
say
at
the
byronic
man
my
latest
blog
find
i
know
i
m
gonna
love
the
blend
of
humor
and
pop
culture
here
anybody
who
ever
took
english
lit
will
appreciate
this
post
it
s
fun
to
participate
too
almost
a
year
back
i
had
written
a
post
on
getting
the
best
from
your
team
where
does
one
start
i
where
i
had
explored
a
couple
of
ideas
that
a
startup
had
applied
towards
building
a
great
motivated
team
as
i
recall
a
bumper
sticker
on
popcorn
sutton's
truck
read
never
let
the
truth
get
in
the
way
of
a
good
story
keep
that
in
mind
when
talking
about
one
of
american
moonshine's
most
prolific
self
promoters
cutler
to
eve
so
this
is
how
it
ends
this
is
what
it
was
all
for
i
saw
this
funny
word
on
the
side
of
the
jar
fluffernutter
interesting
thank
you
gail
for
having
me
today
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
did
all
my
own
sawing
and
nailing
on
this
project
with
hubby
out
of
town
i
had
no
choice
it
wasn
t
to
bad
actually
i
m
looking
forward
doing
some
more
i
love
reading
about
life
and
romance
in
the
rockies
and
these
books
are
centered
around
a
bead
shop
they
are
easy
reads
page
turners
and
thayne
crafted
a
community
i
would
love
to
be
a
part
of
both
books
i
downloaded
on
my
kindle
app
for
my
iphone
from
amazon
com
and
i
did
not
wake
my
hubby
up
while
sleepless
in
ba
book
iii
will
be
out
in
october
2012
and
i
can
not
wait
i
hope
thayne
keeps
writing
this
series
in
counter
terrorism
gaining
operational
experience
of
all
forms
of
violent
political
threats
to
the
uk
why
so
can
i
or
so
can
any
man
then
it
began
to
pour
and
my
phone
battery
died
the
basic
principal
here
in
case
you
are
not
up
to
speed
is
you
are
eating
goose
liver
a
giant
fat
goose
liver
i
lived
amongst
storms
just
as
it
s
unwise
to
walk
around
with
a
hard
three
hundred
cash
it
s
plain
to
keep
all
your
money
in
one
debit
account
atm
fraud
and
online
hackers
are
real
threats
i
ve
met
two
americans
in
brazil
who
lost
over
us
30
000
because
they
were
careless
with
their
atm
accounts
this
is
not
the
norm
but
apparently
happens
i
m
not
usually
one
for
complaining
but
this
is
just
a
huge
annoyance
that
i
could
have
done
without
since
i
have
only
just
launched
i
have
unfortunately
had
to
increase
postage
prices
to
combat
this
in
addition
to
this
i
have
had
to
restrict
what
i
am
able
to
send
outside
of
the
uk
this
little
hole
started
it
all
it
all
a
year
ish
ago
i
got
a
wild
hair
as
i
tend
to
do
frequently
sorry
babe
i
wondered
what
might
be
hiding
above
the
dropped
ceiling
in
our
kitchen
it
started
innocently
enough
i
took
down
the
drop
in
the
entryway
to
expose
a
beadboard
ceiling
it
was
a
joyous
occassion
that
project
went
so
great
that
i
decided
i
think
the
bodice
could
be
very
pretty
in
a
wide
variety
of
fabrics
i
am
thinking
a
navy
linen
would
be
very
classic
and
a
stripe
is
a
must
that
s
because
the
natural
rate
of
price
appreciation
for
houses
is
zero
after
inflation
prices
will
eventually
stop
falling
they
ll
resume
rising
but
over
the
long
term
they
re
unlikely
to
resume
rising
faster
than
inflation
food
security
increases
food
security
by
making
fresh
food
available
in
the
inner

just
say
that
they
ve
never
quite
his
a

streak
in
the

way
as
some

have
this
is
partly
down
to
their

sending

entries
and
this

the
tactic
they
have
resorted

this

leave
a
separate
comment
saying
you
did
and
boy
do
those
flaws
become
obvious
it
is
actually
amazing
how
obvious
they
are
things
we
found
cute
and
clever
in
our
query
all
of
a
sudden
revealed
themselves
for
what
they
were
two
ton
anchors
weighing
the
thing
down
and
that
is
when
we
realized
something
maby
it
is
not
so
bad
to
have
somebody
deciding
everything
for
you
back
on
the
good
eating
tomorrow
chinese
hot
mmmm
then
the
1980s
and
1990s
as
now
clerics
on
saudi
tv
were
obsessed
with
women
and
their
orifices
especially
what
came
out
of
them
i
ll
never
forget
hearing
that
if
a
baby
boy
urinated
on
you
you
could
go
ahead
and
pray
in
the
same
clothes
yet
if
a
baby
girl
peed
on
you
you
had
to
change
what
on
earth
in
the
girl
s
made
you
impure
i
wondered
has
just
become
an
evil
person
who
wants
to
destroy
your
life
it
s
a
boatload
of
work
and
i
m
eager
to
get
it
finished
whilst
escaping
again
they
cross
into
german
lines
and
are
captured
the
doctor
tries
to
persuade
the
german
lieutenant
that
they
are
not
spies
and
even
demonstrates
the
sonic
screwdriver
by
removing
and
replacing
a
from
his
revolver
in
exactly
the
same
way
smythe
did
the
german
major
von
weich
uses
a
monocle
to
brainwash
his
lieutenant
they
manage
to
escape
once
more
and
head
for
the
centre
of
the
map
wherein
we
discover
the
next
layer
of
this
elaborate
plot
so
let
s
spend
the
day
enjoying
the
sounds
of
christmas
and
the
company
of
the
widdershins
5
make
money
irene
gave
us
some
examples
then
asked
us
to
consider
and
write
a
poem
about
the
feeling
of
loneliness
she
suggested
we
look
beyond
the
usual
metaphors
and
get
more
personal
in
our
understanding
and
expression
of
that
sense
of
being
we
commonly
call
loneliness
if
you
still
have
some
poetic
breath
following
april
now
please
share
this
first
may
poem
with
us
and
thank
you
irene
i
have
distressed
the
edges
with
crackle
paint
picket
fence
and
distress
ink
walnut
stain
i
have
always
loved
being
part
of
a
group
that
has
inspired
so
many
to
stretch
themselves
in
so
many
ways
it
hurts
me
that
some
of
you
have
given
me
the
cold
shoulder
and
shun
me
in
the
very
group
that
i
founded
repurposed
mcmansions
emptied
of
their
human
inhabitants
are
filled
in
later
by
a
troupe
of
mountain
lions
unfortunately
a
lot
of
the
information
on
the
interwebz
about
guest
posting
isn
t
specific
to
publishing
writing
blogs
you
may
hear
that
you
should
search
for
blogs
that
contain
certain
keywords
and
mass
query
them
or
only
approach
bloggers
with
a
high
traffic
ranking
this
advice
can
end
up
wasting
your
time
and
then
you
have
the
gall
to
claim
that
obama
demonizes
them
as
for
getting
a
hardcopy
of
the
book
you
could
have
ordered
one
from
turner
maxwell
from
day
one
we
will
burn
more
calories
when
we
engage
the
larger
muscles
of
the
body
so
deepening
our
warrior
poses
yoga
squats
and
chair
poses
will
increase
the
demand
on
our
large
muscles
therefore
burning
more
calories
so
for
example
in
our
class
this
week
at
yoga
with
nicci
as
we
moved
through
chandra
namaskar
moon
salutation
with
many
squats
trikonasana
etc
you
would
definitely
have
been
working
into
the
larger
muscles
of
the
body
through
a
flowing
sequence
of
asanas
another
main
centre
of
resistance

they
will
not

anything

it

been
endorsed
by

and
presents
no

clearly
ceding

not

gave
the

approach

and
how
well
is
being
used
i
m
an
open
heart
and
mind
i
am
accepting
you
and
more
importantly
i
am
accepting
myself
a
salon
co
ordinator
at
the
moment
in
a
sunny
north
texas
who
spends
more
than
i
have
but
creates
even
more
a
people
person
in
a
twisted
way
a
blogger

poor
writer
who
refuses
to
give
up
a
daughter

stranger
and
a
list
of
endless
titles
happy
happy
and
hopeful
is
what
i
am
our
solution
for
architecture
and
interiors
we
all
agree
a
one
party
state
is
not
good
for
democracy
how
important
it
is
then
to
make
sure
it
s
not
just
a
shoe
in
for
more
tories
in
the
coming
election
think
before
you
put
your
cross
7x
island
i
had
time
whoever
told
you
that
life
is
equal
or
fair
was
trying
to
sell
you
something
nobody
nohow
nowhere
ever
has
an
equal
experience
to
that
of
somebody
else
somehow
else
somewhere
else
every
individual's
experience
is
unique
whether
they
are
unschooling
or
attending
public
school
or
matriculating
at
some
upscale
private
institution
some
families
have
more
money
resources
than
others
some
have
more
opportunities
than
others
they
are
all
simply
different
equal
is
a
chimera
forget
it
it
is
neither
important
nor
realistic
unique
individually
tailored
experience
is
the
important
concept
here
it
does
not
matter
that
my
experience
in
life
is
not
equal
to
yours
what
is
important
is
that
mine's
mine
and
yours
is
yours
patek
philippe
watches
could
be
the
probably
the
most
high
priced
look
at
on
this
planet
this
is
the
good
fortune
look
at
that
is
bequeathed
to
1
and
also
the
body's
rich
if
the
look
at
comes
maybe
you
have
witnessed
one
such
different
watches
in
advance
of
this
look
at
is
designed
by
the
most
effective
look
at
makers
in
physical
exercise
this
timpiece
was
first
announced
in
1932
and
so
this
watch
still
is
building
dunes
in
price
tag
and
status
do
not
dismay
in
regards
to
the
price
tag
since
it
is
probably
the
most
affordable
in
relation
to
patek
philippe
different
watches
most
of
these
different
watches
from
patek
philippe
is
often
computerized
or
perhaps
guidebook
in
relation
to
their
action
plus
you
will
find
the

types
as
well
this
is
why
you
have
the
deluxe
of
selecting
the
main
one
you
desire
we
decided
to
go
on
hiatus
last
fall
when
our
guitarist
david
wyatt
became
a
dad
the
plan
was
to
start
playing
again
after
sxsw
but
as
anyone
who
s
ever
tried
to
restart
a
coordinated
collective
effort
with
no
reward
beyond
the
doing
knows
inertia
is
a
formidable
foe
rant
over
got
to
get
used
to
other
people
s
approach
to
life
racked
06
08
2009
in
the
scheme
of
things
i
haven
t
been
to
many
black
belt
retreats
at
all
only
3
in
total
4
including
the
one
that
i
plan
on
attending
this
year
even
so
i
rarely
took
the
time
to
think
back
to
my
first
retreat
experience
in
8th
grade
now
that
i
ve
been
asked
to
recollect
these
memories
so
many
of
them
are
rushing
back
to
me
the
floodgates
seem
to
be
opening
there
are
quite
a
few
experiences
that
highlighted
my
first
retreat
i
woke
the
next
morning
feeling
achingly
sad
as
you
know
i
m
normally
a
glass
half
full
sort
of
person
i
walked
moll
through
a
churchyard
full
of
the
sweet
spring
scent
of
bluebells
mixed
with
the
pungent
earthy
smell
of
wild
garlic
and
thought
how
difficult
it
is
when
people
you
care
about
have
to
go
away
even
when
you
know
they
re
coming
back
what
is
of
particular
interest
to
me
is
the
reaction
of
the
press
many
of
the
old
boys
and
parents
to
the
arrest
of
those
responsible
for
the
brutal
initiations
at
parktown
boys
in
2009
and
the
contrast
to
the
reitzhuis
incident
in
2008
as
well
as
other
incidents
of
initiation
at
afrikaans
language
schools
and
university
residences
the
other
group
consumers
wants
to
buy
2
waffle
makers
39
blu
ray
players
and
all
sorts
of
gadgets
and
goodies
many
of
which
they
could
easily
live
without
so
why
do
the
consumers
get
a
pass
at
any
other
time
of
the
year
one
could
reasonably
expect
to
be
cited
for
trespassing
for
camping
out
in
a
tent
in
front
of
a
retail
establishment
private
property
but
when
black
friday
or
a
twilight
premiere
is
involved
such
campers
risk
not
pepper
spray
tear
gas
or
jabs
from
night
sticks
but
interviews
by
friendly
local
television
news
reporters
the
rumor
is
that
mccain
actually
wanted
tiny
fey
to
be
his
running
mate
but
when
she
turned
him
down
liverpool
are
favourites
they
ve
got
so
many
great
players
but
a
semi
final
at
wembley
is
a
one
off
and
a
local
derby
is
a
one
off
it
s
all
on
the
day
but
to
put
a
positive
spin
on
it
because
i
do
not
want
to
be
debbie
downer
or
better
yet
cynical
cyndy
it
kinda
works
i
am
really
excited
about
the
new
school
year
yesterday
i
bought
a
brand
spankin
 
new
toyota
sienna
se
which
i
am
completely
in
love
with
i
drove
around
scoping
out
b2s
prices
today
only
because
i
wanted
to
drive
my
new
car
my
physical
therapy
today
measured
that
i
have
regained
full
mobility
in
my
flexing
of
my
right
foot
and
am
still
working
and
improving
on
the
pointing
but
my
new
ankle
is
getting
better
each
day
and
i
truly
am
excited
to
get
back
to
work
not
just
for
a
full
paycheck
although
i
will
love
that
but
for
the
distraction
and
the
fresh
start
to
getting
life
back
to
normal
my
oldest
daughter
will
be
starting
kindergarten
at
my
school
this
year
and
i
will
be
the
english
component
of
the
dual
immersion
program
for
1st
grade
we
also
just
hired
a
new
superintendent
we
have
some
changes
ahead
and
i
can
not
wait
to
get
back
to
life
as
i
remember
it
being
the
most
puzzling
poster
is
the
one
of
sarkozy
kissing
frau
merkel
the
couple
were
allies
the
last
time
i
checked
so
why
show
them
kissing
could
sarko
have
bribed
the
fashion
house
to
do
it
because
he
wanted
to
make
his
wife
jealous
a
new
mother
is
often
so
infatuated
with
her
baby
that
she
neglects
her
husband
s
needs
maybe
the
poster
will
prompt
carla
to
accelerate
her
programme
of
exercises
so
she
can
wrap
her
luscious
thighs
around
sarko
the
next
time
he
ventures
into
the
marital
bed
if
he
keeps
on
fantasizing
about
getting
into
frau
merkel's
pants
it
might
damage
the
french
national
interest
she
doesn
t
look
like
the
sort
of
woman
who
ll
give
it
away
for
nothing
i
will
admit
that
a
little
laziness
does
kick
in
when
everything
is
covered
with
snow
and
i
am
perfectly
content
to
stay
out
of
the
the
garden
for
a
day
or
two
i
certainly
do
not
stop
thinking
about
it
though
according
to
the
ner
equipment
owners
should
register
their
equipment
immediately
the
next
step
is
to
consider
your
insurance
coverage
although
most
business
owners
take
the
insurance
offered
by
the
leasing
company
an
inland
marine
policy
may
be
your
most
cost
effective
avenue
and
the
best
defense
against
financial
loss
due
to
equipment
thieves
adding
the
equipment
to
your
current
business
policy
may
also
be
an
option
so
speak
with
your
agent
or
contact
the
nsa
group
with
any
additional
questions
i
got
to
norman
regional
healthplex
this
morning
at
6
27
and
was
given
a
buzzer
at
registration
so
they
could
call
me
back
because
they
did
not
open
for
another
3
minutes
they
called
me
back
verified
my
information
put
a
bracelet
on
me
and
i
waited
i
got
called
back
again
shortly
after
and
was
taken
back
to
a
room
and
given
the
fizz
less
orange
drink
she
told
me
i
had
5
minutes
to
drink
it
i
was
thirsty
and
i
did
not
have
time
to
mess
around
so
it
was
gone
in
less
than
a
minute
and
it
really
was
not
that
bad
i
told
adam
it
tasted
like
a
stronger
version
of
the
hi
c
orange
at
mcdonalds
that
had
been
mixed
right
he
understood
that
analogy
lol
believe
me

the

cut
jason

off

then
jason
popped
out

did
it
i
couldn

even
scream

was
falling
off

he
was

there
was
some

conduct
but

never
reached
the

thing
happened
i
had
mistakenly
assumed
i
had
another
jar
of
teabags
stashed
in
the
back
of
a
cupboard
but
no
no
tea
to
be
found
and

darkened

it

when
the
only
thing
that
saves
me
from

of

so
happy
and
i
mean
so
happy
that
he
talked
about
it
for
a
week
several
times
a
day
i
love
that
i
did
not
allow
the
fact
that
i
was
makeup
free
and
had
not
showered
in
2
days
or
even
being
too
self
conscious
in
general
stop
me
from
dressing
up
and
smiling
for
a
camera
to
make
my
sweet
boy
that
happy
thrills
me
and
i
did
not
miss
our
on
that
moment
then
looking
at
the
kids
went
on
about
how
fun
that
must
be
at
this
point
i
got
frustrated
with
the
movie
and
sighed
loudly
several
times
which
only
succeeded
in
bringing
darwin
into
the
room
looking
to
be
taken
for
a
walk
which
i
did
because
the
expectations
of
a
dog
who
might
soil
your
rug
are
never
to
be
denied
i
also
wore
the
blazer
with
black
trouser
jeans
left
and
with
gray
slacks
right
i
liked
the
contrast
of
the
bright
white
with
the
darker
color
pattern
so
wore
a
white
top
with
it
twice
both
white
tops
had
ruffle
detailing
and
on
the
jeans
pic
i
accessorized
with
a
raspberry
color
belt
and
yes
once
we
legally
bought
those
books
from
amazon
they
became
our
personal
property
and
as
such
we
can
do
with
them
as
we
wish
as
to
joan

charge
she
never
got
paid
for
them

amanda

was
a
treat
to
work
with
on
jennifer

she
s
insanely
talented
and
completely
down
to

cuba
gooding
jr
hardwired
was
also
a
class
act
and
very
generous
as
an
actor
i
also
got
my
kicked
by
joshua
jackson
in
fringe
literally
we
did
a
fight
scene
together
and
i
got
to
do
my
own
stunts
on
that
one
he
was
a
good
man
although
it
wasn
t
really
with
an
actor
getting
my
head
blown
off
by
a
predator
in
avp2
was
a
highlight
too
about
infinitive
analytics
however
the
film
does
have
a
great
morbid
atmosphere
to
it
when
the
cenobites
show
up
sort
of
like
a
darker
nightmare
on
elm
street
or
something
and
the
story
progresses
in
a
rather
noir
meets
occult
type
of
fashion
that
reminds
me
of
really
old
school
gothic
horror
doug
bradley
is
a
great
actor
as
pinhead
and
whenever
he

so
last
night
i
did
something
fun
in
ancient
times
the
birthright
was
a
very
important
and
sacred
thing
it
belonged
to
the
firstborn
he
would
also
receive
a
chief
portion
of
the
inheritance
but
it
was
more
than
just
a
title
to
the
physical
assets
of
a
family
it
was
also
a
spiritual
position
and
in
the
case
of
the
people
of
would
lead
the
family
through
patriarchs
or
fathers
hebrews

additionally
in
the
special
case
of
esau
and
jacob
that
meant
the
one
to
whom
belonged
the
birthright
was
the
one
through
who
the
covenant
promise
made
to
their
grandfather
abraham
would
be
realized
ultimately
the
messiah
would
come
through
the
holder
of
the
birthright
and
bless
the
nations
of
the
earth

esau
gave
this
up

only
i
found

that

i

barack

a

educated

who
made
his

george
and
i
behaved
like
proper
tourists
and
got
a
2
day
bus
pass
for
the
red
and
blue
city
busses
that
took
us
to
different
places
it
is
a
hop
on
hop
off
set
up
and
the
bus
is
never
late
and
it
doesn
t
wait
for
you
it
is
the
most
efficient
system
i
have
ever
seen
and
so
well
co
ordinated
the
red
bus
takes
you
through
the
city
the
blue
bus
on
the
outskirts
it
was
so
awesome
check

but
does
anybody
seriously
believe
for
one
minute
that
bain
would
be
nearly
as
successful
as
it
has
been
under
a
sound
economy
with
a
bare
minimum
of
regulatory
interference
no
more
than
necessary
let's
get
real
here
our
regulatory
system
has
created
an
atmosphere
that
is
conducive
to
business
failure
as
it
contributes
in
large
to
the
sluggishness
of
our
economy
i
will
not
venture
to
say
what
percentage
of
business
failures
are
directly
attributable
to
our
oppressive
regulatory
regimes
but
i
do
know
that
it
has
to
be
significant
common
sense
tells
you
that
my
sewing
suffered
as
i
did
a
ton
of
knitting
for
the
issues
but
my
sewing
is
now
in
focus
for
a
bit
i
have
joined
a
couple
of
bees
and
a
couple
of
swaps
and
found
a
group
of
ladies
who
understand
my
wit
and
creative
mojo
you
know
who
you
are
today's
post
is
to
welcome
other
colors
and
boost
up
any
dish
with
health
benefits
my
newest
favorite
addition
to
our
dishes
is
the
pepper
i
have
been
buying
a
bag
of
what
they
call
small
sweet
peppers
the
colors
are
just
great
my
decorating
genes
are
delighted
to
add
more
color
to
our
meals
of
course
spring
will
bring
us
even
more
color
for
our
consumption

the
devastation

while

from
it
i
have
also
made
several
dishes
from
her
website
my
hubby

loved
each

i
have
made
it
is
simple
down

the
kind

i
am
not

to

appreciates
a

brun
rose
was
a
complete
surprise
for
me
it
looks
more
brown
rose
in
the
pan
but
swatches
as
a
coral
pink
as
shown
it
is
very
pigmented
on
my
arm
but
is
quite
soft
and
subtle
on
the
cheeks
when
applied
with
a
chanel
blush
brush
i
get
a
soft
peachy
glow
brun
rose
combined
with
lumiere

de
chanel
highlighter
is
a
killer
combination
here
are
the
sketches
for
the
mask
that
i
have
done
so
far
i
used
some
pictures
on
the
web
as
a
reference
because
i
am
not
awesome
at
drawing
but
for
the
time
being
get
use
to
the
lumping
of
failed
policies
mantra
like
the
coming
attractions
like
any
future
here's
a
photograph
to
gladden
the
heart
of
any
traditional
catholic

to
give

then
after
a
balmy
60
degree
week
of
weather
we
have
a
freak
snowstorm
which
brings
12
inches
of
heavy
sloppy
snow
this
october
storm
was
definitely
a
record
breaker
for
the
state
of
connecticut
since
we
usually
do
not
see
snow
until
late
november

december
the

how
often

e
til
the

this
gets

think
they

it

at

the

not

up

for

any

establishment
mefs
we
stand
and
fight
our
corner
this
emasculates
the
general
population
of
uk
into
realising
they
are

s
because
they
would
sooner
take
it
up
the
wrong
un
than
stand
and
fight

i
think
so
you
can
barely
move
in
the
summer
months
nowadays
for
the
sheer
volume
of
music
festival
coverage
on
tv
some
good
some
bad
but
most
indifferent
but
the
televisual
festival
landscape
was
a
very
different
place
back
in
the
mid
80s
oh
yes
unless
there
was
a
special
one
off
event
such
as
live
aid
in
1985
or
umm
that
free
nelson
mandela
thingy
a
few
years
later
you'd
be
left
with
the
bbc's
annual
highlights
only
coverage
of
the
montreux
pop
festival
from
switzerland
in
may
the
line
ups
were
generally
frighteningly
mainstream
but
as
i
was
going
through
my
prime
mainstream
pop
years
at
the
time
that
was
perfectly
fine
with
me
an
hour
passed
with
peter
sipping
drinks
and
going
over
the
options
in
his
mind
for
his
next
great
adventure
when
the
door
facing
bourbon
street
opened
and
a
beautiful
black
woman
entered
peter
was
stunned
at
the
beauty
of
the
unknown
woman
who
while
wearing
just
a
business
suit
carried
herself
like
a
queen
entering
a
room
full
of
commoners
no
one
person
is
like
you
in
every
way
if
i
were
involved
with
a
guy
who
was
exactly
the
same
as
me
i'd
probably
get
bored
really
fast
so
why
would
i
expect
someone
else
to
act
be
and
approach
the
world
in
the
same
way
as
me
i
do
not
yet
in
relationships
with
a
partner
we
often
do
expect
the
other
person
to
react
the
same
as
we
would

is
that
mom
that
her
partner
and
son
are
very
very
lucky
to
have
church
officials
did
not
cite
a
specific
example
of
those
public
statements
but
said
the
reform
would
include
a
review
of
ties
between
the
leadership
conference
and
network
a
catholic
social
justice
lobby
network
played
a
key
role
in
supporting
the
obama
administration
s
health
care
overhaul
despite
the
bishops
objections
that
the
bill
would
provide
government
funding
for
abortion
the
leadership
conference
disagreed
with
the
bishops
analysis
of
the
law
and
also
supported
president
barack
obama
s
plan
this
film
also
provides
a
first
hand
look
at
a
bona

bigfoot
conference
in
honobia
oklahoma
in
addition
we
get
a
glimpse
at

possible

are
shown
a
considerable
amount
of
evidence
from
other
amateur
researchers
i
met
mark
at
a
brewery
on
st
patty
s
day
i
wasn
t
really
looking
for
a
guy
at
this
point
but
i
wasn
t
not
looking
anyway
this
brewery
is
not
really
a
place
to
meet
people
but
it
was
a
good
place
to
go
watch
the
game
and
drink
green
chile
beer
with
my
girlfriends
by
the
way
if
you
haven
t
had
green
chile
beer
you
need
to
try
it
it

i
lost
some
of

shadows
when
i
colored
the
shirt
with

so
i
went
back
with
my
gray
and
darkened
those
areas
again

this
dresser
has
been
around
for
quite
awhile
it
was
actually
purchased
by
my
mom
who
intended
on
refinishing
it
herself
about
ten
years
ago
it
has
been
sitting
in
her
garage
ever
since
i
recently
purchased
a
new
house
and
asked
my
mom
if
it
would
be
okay
to
use
this
piece
as
my
first
project
i
knew
it
would
look
great
in
my
daughter's
room
it
had
really
nice
detail
and
i
wanted
to
give
her
a
piece
of
furniture
with
a
story
behind
it
that
they
managed
to
slow
down
for
5
seconds
so
i
could
snap
a
photo
how
was
art
deco
style
used
to
create
a
modern
look
in
the
1920s
and
30s

do
sincerely
apologize

did
not
communicate
clearly
with

this

the
phoenix
is
a
legendary
mythical
bird
that
appears
in
one
form
or
another
in
the
lore
of
multiple
ancient
cultures
such
as
in
egyptian
chinese
persian
greek
roman
and
phoenician
tales
to

the
phoenix
at
the
end
of
one
life
cycle
builds
a
nest
that
bursts
into
flame
consuming
both
the
bird
and
nest
in
fire
and
reducing
them
to
ashes
from
these
ashes
a
young
phoenix
or
egg
emerges
renewed
and
reborn
to
live
once
again
considered
benevolent
sacred
and
magical
it
was
often
depicted
as
a
beautiful
and
powerful
bird
a
fire
spirit
a
free
spirited
being
who
was
an
allegorical
or
symbolic
embodiment
of
the
concepts
of
beauty
virtue
triumph
over

resurrection

ya

are
i
know
this
may
come
across
as
paranoia
but
it
s
merely
a
shift
in
awareness
from
merely
myself
to
how
i
fit
in

with

people
this
was
what
she'd
been
training

then
more
training
never
like
the
other

always
working
twice
as
hard
no

for

but
she'd
wanted
it
wanted
it
like
when
you
find
something
elemental
in
your

and
know
it
belongs
to
you
to
shape

she
was
meant
to
be
an
olympian
so
what
if
this
whole
thing
was
a
little
well
unusual
she
trusted
her
father
trusted
him
completely
if
he
said
this
place
was
safe
then
it
was
and
of
course
they
would
follow
the
rules
he
finally
overcame
me
and
beat
on
my
windows
cracking
them
i
drove
faster
and
faster
but
it
didn
t
help
i
helplessly
watched
him
shatter
the
windshield
and
my
vision
was
distorted
from
the
broken
glass
the
he
did
something
i
didn

count
on
he
took
his
scythe

chopped
my

i
am
not
jumping
into
any
conclusions
i
don
t
usually
like
narrators
who
provide
commentary
i
figure
give
us
the
story
and
let
us
make
up
our
own
minds
in
the
case
of
dead
kid
however
the
narrator
s
personality
is
as
much
a
character
as
october
and
the
dead
kids
and
i
love
his
snappy
asides
and
geeky
references
from
page
6
but
even
if
her
classmates
didn
t
know
october
was
sure
they
could
smell
the
tween
on
her
the
stench
of
sour
keys
and
saturday
morning
cartoons
not
sure
if
it
was
the
phrase
smell
the
tween
on
her
or
the
stench
of
saturday
morning
cartoons
but
with
that
line
i
was
hooked
now
do
not
you
feel
better
already
just

i

whichever

we

that

a

setting

on

venture

or
any

my
point

that

i
think
it
is
fairly
well
known
that
i
do
not
like
jmpd
after
this
december
i
dislike
them
to
the
extent
that
i
refuse
to
acknowledge
their
legal
ability
to
enforce
the
traffic
laws
no
one
seems
to
get
why
well
lets
take
a
canter
through
some
of
the
achievements
of
jmpd
their
big
boss
sbu
ndebele
and
the
sa

system
as
a
whole
just
remember
the
likes
of
rhonda
rousy
aaron
riley
john

and
a

of

fighters
started
in

amateur
ranks
if
talent
like
that
got
their

shouldn
t
we
show
some
respect
to

that
helped

being
new
to
bombay
i
was
carrying
a
letter
of
introduction
to
mr
k
m
munshi
a
man
of
erudition
who
had
embellished
public
life
in
so
many
ways
he
had
also
earned
a
niche
for
himself
as
the
founder
of
bharati
vidya
bhawan
a
trend
setter
in
the
academic
world
too
reticent
to
open
up
at
one
go
it
took
several
meetings
to
find
him
as
a
warm
affectionate
and
effusive
person
and
then
something
happened
actually
a
conversation
happened
i
ranted
to
my
friends
about
how
difficult
it
was
how
i
had
daily
discussions
about
our
food
and
about
just
how
sick
of
it
i
was
i
was
given
a
simple
piece
of
advice
give
them
more
control
in
the
matter
i
would
suggest
instead
that
interpretatio
style
syncretisms
are
more
like
translational
realities
rather
than
equational
realities
some
might
wonder
what
the
difference
is
and
if
it
is
simply
a
matter
of
semantics
but
let
me
give
you
an
example
from
the
modern
world
instead
to
show
the
difference
if
i
were
to
say
that
luke
skywalker
is
the
wesley
crusher
of
the
star
wars
universe
first
of
all
you
d
probably
be
terrified
and
horrified
at
such
a
comparison
depending
on
whether
you
liked
star
wars
or
star
trek
better
but
if
one
steps
back
for
a
moment
one
can
see
that
some
analogizing
is
going
on
here
but
not
necessarily
equating
yes
use
of
is
makes
it
a
metaphor
rather
than
an
analogy
but
recall
that
metaphor
is
simply
the
greek
exact
equivalent
of
the
latin
term
translatio
which
is
to
say
carrying
across
it
is
a
manner
of
creating
common
meaning
between
things
but
not
necessarily
making
something
completely
into
something
else
no
matter
how
much
i
say
i
m
a
bulldozer
in
a
certain
situation
that
does
not
turn
me
into
a
bulldozer
likewise
saying
that
luke
skywalker
is
the
wesley
crusher
of
the
star
wars
universe
does
not
make
luke
into
wesley
does
not
suddenly
mean
that
dr
crusher
is
his
mother
and
therefore
is
padme
amidala
or
that
therefore
darth
vader
or
obi
wan
kenobi
is
captain
jean
luc
picard
it
simply
states
that
there
is
an
analogy
and
one
can
understand
the
role
of
the
other
if
one
is
not
familiar
with
it
by
this
other
typologically
similar
image
this
makes
of
such
syncretisms
through
interpretatio
not
soft
polytheism
as
many
accuse
syncretism
in
general
of
being
but
instead
a
kind
of
typology
early
structuralism
or
even
archetypalism
but
with
the
important
difference
of
stating
that
these
things
are
different
but
they
have
certain
similarities
this
more
metaphorical
more
nuanced
understanding
of
interpretatio
syncretisms
and
of
syncretism
in
general
is
one
that
can
be
potentially
very
productive
for
modern
polytheists
and
can
also
be
useful
in
understanding
how
the
various
ancient
european
peoples
analogized
their
deities
and
yet
still
could
have
seen
them
in
ways
that
preserved
the
integrity
and
distinctiveness
of
each
figure
some
didn
t

course

often
did
do
this
in
a
more
thorough
and
attentive
manner
veep
isn
t
a
bad
show
not
by
any
stretch
there
is
a
lot
to
like
about
it
but
i
was
kind
of
stunned
when
the
end
of
the
show
came
and
i
wasn
t
bowled
over
as
i
ve
written
before
comedy
pilots
are
especially
difficult
to
do
well
and
veep
may
have
suffered
the
burden
of
my
too
high
expectations
i
was
so
excited
about
the
show
that
it
was
going
to
be
difficult
for
it
to
live
up
the
hype
i
usually
try
to
temper
my
anticipation
but
this
show
seemed
to
be
so
in
my
wheelhouse
that
i
failed
to
do
that
this
time
no
shortcuts
is
performed
as
an
incantation
complete
with
heartbeat
percussion
the
journey
it
describes
seems
at
first
to
be
a
physical
one
but
it
soon
becomes
apparent
that
it
is
a
metaphor
that
the
journey
is
also
emotional
and
spiritual
the
song
could
serve
as
an
overture
for
this
post
since
many
journeys
are
taken
here
heather
maloney
is
telling
us
in
her
impassioned
voice
that
we
can
not
simply
break
through
boundaries
that
there
must
be
a
newly
created
structure
to
replace
them
freedom
is
the
ability
to
define
that
structure
for
yourself
maloney
is
not
limited
in
the
way
that
some
songwriters
and
artists
are
her
voice
can
convey
gravity
in
a
mid
alto
range
but
she
can
also
soar
into
a
high
soprano
for
bursts
of
exuberance
or
flights
of
fancy
her
album
time
pocket
change
does
not
fit
neatly
into
any
musical
genre
but
it
is
a
coherent
document
held
together
by
the
strength
of
her
personality
maloney
looks
at
life
from
a
slightly
odd
angle
and
in
doing
so
helps
us

the

but
yeah
the

character
myself
i
would
not
think
that
one
person
could
change
so
much
in
three
years
i
understand
that
the
dynamic
is
that
there
had

be

supreme
reed
famous
for
its
insularity
perhaps
wants
to
become

and
engaged

or
perhaps
the
same
qualities
that
made
him
a
successful
candidate
for
attorney
general
were
evident
in
the
interview
process
he
knows
how
to
talk
a
good
game
and
get
folks
to
open
their
wallets
i
personally
hope
it
is
at
least
some
of
the
former
i
think
reed
has
lost
some
of
its
luster
partly
because
of
its
stubborn
unwillingness
to
evolve
perhaps
that
is
still
a
strength
but
i
think
less
and
less
so
in
the
21st
century
in
many
ways
it
was
like
the
time
i
first
went
to
demonstrate
at
two
in
the
morning
against
cruise
missile
convoys
coming
back
into
greenham
common
there
was
the
reality
of
the
cold
war
visible
and
suddenly
undeniable
and
also
the
reality
of
the
war
itself
which
was
the
precursor
to
my
young
life
and
which
had
carved
its
traces
into
my
mother
and
my
grandparents
and
into
my
father
but
it
took
longer
for
that
to
come
home
to
me
it
was
a

up
a
removal

am
sure
those

is

often
requiring

i
first
noticed

constant
whine
of

at
about
4
pm
today
checking
the
news
i
learned
that
the
occupy
oakland
camp
in
downtown
oakland
had
been
cleared
by
police
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
a
series
of
afternoon
protests
had
been
called
in
the
nearby
area
with
plans
in
place
to
go
downtown
later
that
night
i
searched
the
internet
with
a
mix
of
curiosity
and
anxiety
for
news
of
what
was
happening
a
flurry
of
twitter
messages
at
the
www
occupyoakland

site
detailed
a
few
non
violent
marches
snaking
throughout
the
downtown
area
all
headed
for
the

that
had
become
known
in

as

were
at

with

they
viewed
as

not
drugs
while
drug
addicts
eventually
view
drugs
as
the
idol
or
is
it
alcohol
or
tobacco
do
your
eyes
light
up
when
you
see
all
the

does
that
mean
it
has
become
your

oh
dear
me
if
you
were
not
going
to
go
because
you
are
only
a
beginner
and
do
not
think
you
are
good
enough
a
lot
of
people
are
feeling
that
way
and
that
is
why
we
are
going

be

we
want
beginners
there

we
can

on
saturday
whilst
i
should
have
been
catching
up
with
my
beauty
sleep
i
was
hot
footing
it
to
borough
to
tout
my
wares
at
sainsbury's
great
british
beer
hunt
i
do
not
know
many
brewers
entered
the
competition
but
only
eight
or
nine
companies
turned
up
at
the
promotional
event
i
was
a
little
apprehensive
as
i'd
heard
there
were
going
to
be
200
punters
for
the
tasting
and
i
was
expecting
something
like
when
the
wrong
door
gets
opened
in
a
zombie
film
and
a
shambling
mob
lurches
in
so
you
will
see
a
new
blinkie
added
to
my
page
and
i
want
you
all
to
mark
this
date
because
this
is
one
event
that
you
are
not
going
to
want
to
miss
he
he
i
know
i
can
not
wait
for
it
so
lets
get
on
with
my
creation
to
share
with
you
all
today
i
must
say
that
with
the
passing
of
my
friend
this
week
it
has
given
me
a
reality
check
with
how
much
i
really
keep
in
touch
with
them
all
so
i
have
been
making
cards
to
send
out
to
friends
and
family
that
i
do
not
get
to
see
or
talk
with
much
anymore
my
penultimate
morning
in
england
was
a
grey
affair
it
was
a
biting
cold
march
day
and
i
was
to
meet
john
to
say
goodbye
when
i
met
him
he
was
in
the
middle
of
some
weird
methadone
sell
whereby
he'd
earn
180
and
so
our
last
morning
together
was
spent
trawling
around
shepherds
bush
trying
to
track
down
a
one
legged
addict
called
jack
the
peg
when
we
eventually
found
jack
slopping
down
a
free
breakfast
at
the
great
commision
ministry
church
he
told
us
through
a
mouthful
of
soupy
porridge
that
he
needed
to
cash
his
sick
benefit
before
he
could
buy
john's
methadone
all
together
walking
at
the
pace
of
a
man
with
one
leg
and
two
rusty
crutches
we
pigeon
stepped
it
jack
in
the
singular
down
to
the
post
office
and
queued
up
behind
the
dead
the
pregnant
and
the
insane
still
his
two
feet
fascinated
them
more
and
more
newly
with
each
step
this
whole
thing
got
me
thinking
where
are
these
virgins
come
from
i
guess
girls
go
to
heaven
just
like
men
if
that
the
case
these
girls
must
be
so
who
can
stay
a
until
they
go
to
heaven
so
there
is
another
reason
for
me
to
decline
and
again
who
can
deal
with
seventy
to
ladies
i
know
many
highly
educated
muslim
friends
and
i
asked
them
the
same
question
they
also
confused
but
i
never
tried
to
push
this
any
farther
because
i
did
not
want
to
shake
their
faith
sometimes
it
amaze
me
to
see
their
untamed
faith
their
faith
is
so
strong
and
beautiful
may
be
that
is
the
reason
that
religious
extremists
manipulate
them
so
easy
on
the
other
hand
i
do
question
everything
neither
bible
nor
koran
can
make
me
believe
just
because
something
was
written
in
there
it
has
to
make
me
understand
it
doesn
t
mean
i
don
t
believe
in
i
do
believe
in
higher
power
most
people
call
him
and
he
had
helped
me
many
times
if
i
do
anything
in
the
name
of
or
religion
then
it
has
to
agree
with
my
heart
i
am
not
ready
to
harm
any
living
thing
just
because
of
someone
offered
me
seventy
two
virgins
i
mean
where
is
the
fun
having
someone
hand
over
seventy
two
girls
i
like
to
work
for
it
i
like
go
to
my
favorite
bar
and
sit
in
a
corner
and
stare
at
the
girl
i
like
not
knowing
what
to
do
2
rear
warning
be
prepared
to
have
lots
of
time
on
your
side
cause
you
re
gonna
need
it
your
mouth
will
water
with
all
the
gorgeous
files
she
s
designed
be
sure
to
leave
her
some
blog
love
too
she
certainly
deserves
it
the
bartlett
yarn
is
similar
to
briggs
and
little
regal
with
lots
of
vm
vegetable
matter
that
is
vegetation
that
got
caught
in
the
sheep
s
wool
as
it
was
out
grazing
and
doing
whatever
it
is
that
sheep
do
that
i
picked
out
as
i
knit
i
don
t
mind
vm
in
yarn
because
it
is
an
indication
that
the
wool
has
not
be
over
processed
the
yarn
from
bartlett
is
pretty
scratchy
before
it
is
washed
but
it
softens
a
lot
after
washing
it
also
blooms
a
lot
when
washed
the
beanie
i
knitted
on
3
5mm
needles
looks
almost
felted
since
it
was
washed
i
m
glad
i
used
4
0mm
needles
for
the
ribbed
hat
who
kept
trying
to
help
me
by
trying
to
help
jaikob
i
decided
to
email
leila
and
ask
for
help
what
do
i
do
with
this
i
feel
like
an
absolute
idiot
asking
for
prayers
particularly
because
i
know
just
how
embarrassed
i
am
going
to
feel
in
two
weeks
when
i
have
to
come
on
here
and
announce
that
i
got
my
period
again
how
could
i
possibly
after
6
years
expect
anything
to
be
different
how
could
i
so
boldly
ask
all
of
you
to
pray
for
me
as
if
i
am
so
important
and
my
getting
pregnant
deserves
an
army
of
prayer
warriors
who
the
heck
do
i
think
i
am
2
t
oil
of
having
an
accent
but
just
reinforcing
obliviousness
you
broke
up
with
heather
since
i
began
training
i
have
had
shin
splints
extremely
sore
ankles
a
broken
toe
not
anything
to
do
with
running
just
the
hazards
of
someone
who
loves
to
be
barefoot
and
now
my
knee
it
seems
every
time
i
make
some
progress
like
increasing
my
pace
or
adding
a
little
distance
bam
something
starts
to
hurt
i
m
beginning
to
think
that
maybe
jumping
into
minimalist
shoes
again
someone
who
prefers
to
be
barefoot
at
52
might
have
been
a
mistake
my
sparkle

and
chantenay

hello
everyone
i
m
sorry
i
have
been
mia
from
posting
i
missed
writing
on
here
and
hearing
from
all
of
you
i
want
to
than
everyone
who
has
entered
the
giveaway
and
remind
you
all
that
today
is
the
last
day
to
enter
and
next
thursday
the
winner
will
be
announced
i
think
the
cuddle
time
helped
both
of
us
because
i
know
i
needed
that
the
project
also
sparked
a
weekend
full
of
philosophical
conversations
we
do
have
those
a
lot
but
this
was
several
all
in
one
weekend
and
it
helped
us
build
up
a
bunch
of
inspirational
and
motivational
energy
for
the
week
ahead
as
far
as
i
know
the
way
she
is
treated
is
unprecedented
in
the
history
of
the
nobel
peace
prize
norwegian
nobel
committee
secretary
geir
lundestad
told
associated
press
her
situation
is
extremely
regrettable
his
views
are
easy
to
understand
eric
was
a
holocaust
survivor
and
he
watched
as
his
parents
were
ripped
away
from
him
and
then
his
mother
was
murdered
right
before
his
eyes
it
had
been
at
that
time
that
his
power
to
control
all
magnetic
forms
of
metal
first
developed
a
even
experimented
on
him
and
tried
to
use
him
as
a
weapon
xavier
describes
him
as
a
good
man
with
good
intentions
who
is
consumed
by
rage

christmas
is
indeed
the
most
wonderful
time
of
the
year
it
is
the
only
time
when
g
takes
over
the
kitchen
and
prepares
christmas
lunch
leaving
me
in
charge
of
desserts
it
is
relatively
stress
free
for
me
although
i
am
crossing
my
fingers
and
hoping
that
my
maiden
attempt
at
baking
a
red
velvet
cake
tomorrow
will
be
successful
for
now
i
decided
to
make
some
marbled
coke
eggs
which
are
actually
hard
boiled
eggs
which
have
been
simmered
and
steeped
in
a
coke
and
soy
broth
for
a
few
hours
the
marbled
effect
is
created
by
cracking
the
shell
of
the
hard
boiled
eggs
all
over
before
simmering
them
in
coke
the
eggs
would
have
absorbed
a
mildly
sweet
flavour
with
a
hint
of
soy
depending
on
how
long
the
eggs
are
left
in
the
coke
these
can
be
served
warm
or
at
room
temperature
and
are
great
for
picnics
parties
or
just
a
snack
for
the
kids
at
home
and
they
look
quite
pretty
too
thank
you
to
all
at
woodlore
that
supported
us
and
see
you
in
the
not
too
distant
future
on
our
way
out
of
town
we
stopped
at
the
garden
club's
sale
and
i
bought
a
flower
for
1
00
the
temper
of
the
year
so
just
to
clarify
for
anyone
who
fancies
going
along
this
evening
and
you
really
should
i
am
more
than
sure
that
it
will
be
worth
it
you
need
to
see
this
chappy
perform
you
really
do
you
will
not
regret
it
sometimes
we
may
even
feel
it
is
necessary
to
take
a
dump
on
someone
else
just
remember
the
golden
rule
do
unto
others
as
you
would
have
them
do
onto
you
so
let
me
ask
you
do
you
like
when
others
on
you
i
ll
have
my
medicine
bag
with
me
i
take
it
places
where
i
know
i
ll
need
a
little
bit
more
super
power
than
i
normally
have
i
mentioned
this
recently
on
facebook
if
you
d
like
to
friend
me
please
do
and
some
of
my
friends
didn
t
know
what
a
medicine
bag
was
coach
jeff
as
always
did
a
great
job
in
helping
me
get
the
kids
acclimated
to
their
positions
as
well
as
assisting
me
in
coaching
them
on
what
to
do
we
are
so
blessed
this
year
to
have
many
parents
that
are
willing
to
help
the
team
during
practices
and
games
not
everything
happening
is
s
will
but
s
will
for
us
in
whatever
situation
is
to
give
thanks
and
it
becomes
part
of
s
tapestry
for
his
marvelous
plan
for
our
lives

i
would
love
to
have
marble
counter
tops
in
our
future
house
in
the

we
just
moved
into
the
bathroom
has
fake

i
actually
kinda
like
them
how
can
you
injure
your

there
are
many
ways
that
you
can
hurt
it
you
could
hurt
it
while
playing
sports
like
football
basketball
soccer
skiing
or
hockey
my
ones
are
on
this
weeks
show
we
will
ask
the
question
where
did
the
swag
go
are
these
young
people
making
mistakes
or
is
it
much
adieu
about
nothing
one
of

most
significantly

has
helped
millions
of
children
it
has
also
bogged
down
the
courts
and
spawned
a
whole
industry
based
on
paranoia
the
best
part
about
it
was
a
sign
that
was
filmed
at
the
beginning
which
read

the

of

i

had
the
opportunity
to
visit
or
be
a
part
of
many
different
churches
in
many
different
states
and
several
different
countries
by
now
it
s
been
a
real
privilege
to
see
the
churches
meet
their
members
and
many
times
join
in
myself
in
places
such
as
rome
france
south

madagascar
and
of
course
arkansas
missouri
oklahoma
and
oregon
and
a
few
other
states
whose
churches
i
ve
only
visited
have
you
ever
heard
of
modnique
if
you
have
or
haven
t
let
me
give
you
a
quick
run
down
about
modnique
this
is
a
shopping
site
where
you
can
find
designer
brands
for
discount
prices
you
have
to
register
on
the
website
to
be
able
to
shop
they
don
t
have
an
app
for
your
cell
phone
but
they
do
have
a
mobile

site
here
are
just
a

drakes

if
need
be
in

they
are
fiercely
protective
of
any

to

wordpress
com
doesn
t
allow
javascript
so
i
couldn
t
embed
the
graphs
and
have
had
to
make
do
with
screen
shots
instead
next
began
the
taping
of
superstars
and
my
favorite
man
at
raw
tapings
came
out
scott
stanford
i
was
pretty
convinced
he
wouldn
t
see
us
again
they
filmed
the
first
match
which
was
dolph
ziggler
against
mason
ryan
not
a
bad
match
though
mason
ryan
doesn
t
even
look
real
ziggler
gave
scott
his
coat
i
love
those
little
tidbits
and
i
find
it
funnier
that
it
s
always
heels
that
are
doing
nice
things
for
scott
especially
since
scott
would
likely
be
referred
to
as
a

springtime
is
definately
here
in
wellington
all
sorts
of
trees
introduced
from
the
northern
hemisphere
are
starting
to
show
their
glorious
blossoms
and
blooms
and
the
fruit
trees
are
so
welcome
my
local
supermarket
has
a
garden
section
with
plants
raised
to
cope
with
wellington's
frequent
strong
wind
a
joy
to
view
every
springtime
in
new
zealand
is
the
flowering
of
the
native
kowhai
tree
the
last
jelly
neon
from
this
collection
both
jellies
are
quite
sheer
but
they
were
able
to
even
out
slowly
as
they
dried
reminds
us
of
a
the
jeans
collection
from
both
nubar
and
chanel
we
were
never
a
fan
of
such
blue
but
this
jelly
neon
changed
our
mind
we
really
love
this
blue
jelly
layered
with
glitters
and
as
i
write
this
the
west
is
 
dialoging
 
with
iran
whose
leaders
have
repeatedly
pledged
to
destroy
the
jews
in
israel
and
are
busily
working
towards
acquiring
nuclear
weapons
for
their
own
version
of
the
final
solution
just
as
the
west
negotiated
with
while
the
nazis
built
up
their
war
machine
the
fun
part
is
there
is
so
much
more
to
that
idea
the
moment
you
get
that
feeling
of
a
new
idea
there
is
so
much
more
to
it
it
can
go
so
many
ways
and
get
so
much
deeper
it
is
an
irreplaceable
feeling
how
many
of
you
have
ever
seen
someone
and
automatically
judged
who
they
were
and
what
they
thought
whether
or
not
they
were
a
christian
simply
by
their
outward
appearance

this

saturday
march
31
our
small
ceremony
at
home
turned
into
a
bit
larger
celebration
at
a
reception
hall
during
the
planning
process
and
we
had
about
70
people
attend
it
was
a
beautiful
day
that
will
be
remembered
by
us
both
for
the
rest
of
our
lives
we
also
listened
to
a
rich
woman's
lawyer
talk
about
saving
her
property
from
one
such
intrusive
road
project
by
installing
a
modern
roundabout
and
we
then
watched
a
little
video
about
the
roundabouts
which
keep
traffic
moving
and
save
energy
and
so
on
gpats
board
member
jim
burns
immediately
said
it
was
a
good
idea
and
by
my
calculations
noting
the
map
where
this
rich
woman's
property
is
i
figured
out
that
burns
is
her
county
council
representative
so
he
knows
which
side
his
bread
is
buttered
on
as
my
grandmother
used
to
say
exact
some
mental
that
is
the
beauty
of
music

can
sing
about
absolutely
every
aspect
of

near
the
end
of
my
week
long
stay
in
ireland
i
traveled
to
the
south
coast
village
of
cobh
along
the
way
i
spent
a
couple
hours
at
the
botanical
garden
in
fota
the
foliage
displays
at
fota
are
very
extensive
and
offer
a
tremendous
variety
of
plants
between
the
garden
proper
and
the
arboretum
looking
back
i
wish
i
would
have
taken
the
time
to
jot
down
the
names
of
several
of
the
flowers
but
i
guess
not
having
that
information
gives
me
one
more
reason
to
return
the
following
are
the
pictures
of
our
little
sam
and
samantha
the
king
and
queen
of
 
the

ms
i
cannot
review
the
film
in
any
capacity
without
admitting
heath
ledger
s
portrayal
of
the
joker
steals
the
film
the
praise
heaped
upon
leder
s
performance
was
not
just
posthumous
sentimentality
he
would
own
the
role
even
if
he
had
not
tragically
overdosed
months
before
its
release
some
speculate
the
role
may
have
contributed
to
his
damaged
state
of
mind
the
dark
knight
s
version
of
the
joker
took
the
most
demented
homicidal
elements
of
the
character
and
put
them
on
screen
the
then
prime
minister
clement
attlee
walked
in
most
of
what
has
been
done
to
south
african
gun
owners
is
already
being
pushed
in
the
united

gun
rationing
targeting
the
poor
and
people
of
color
making
gun
ownership
unaffordable
confiscating
guns
without
compensation
and
implementing
a
licensing
system
that
can
be
deliberately
abused
in
order
to
stop
good
people
from
owning
guns
he
felt
cold
at
first
but
after
a
moment
a
warm
sensation
slipped
from
her
heart
down
her
arm
her
head
grew
heavy
and
she
closed
her
eyes
a
dim
memory
or
was
it
a
dream
teased
her
a
large
stone
pyramid
a
room
of

dead
the

full
of
grace
the

do
glide

a

to

definitely
something
on

the

i
know
that
is
a

it
certainly
could

a

fantasy
debut
next

for

with

there
are
also
sequels
to
a
number
of

favorites
coming
out
but
i
always
like
to
make
time
for

so
i
will
definitely
be
one
of

by

is
vital

plays

five
performances
usually
rehearses
for
two

three
months
prior
often
two

three
times
a

failure
to

is
virtually
unthinkable
as
everyone
needs

know
their

blocking

and
be
comfortable
working

i
hate
the

there
i
said
it
i
can
never
find
anything
there
and
their

make

look

do
not
ask
for
clarification
just
trust
me
on
that
ok
every
time
i
have
actually
bought
something
at
the
gap
it
has
disintegrated
in
a
matter
of
days
in
the
most
dramatic
way
possible
like
while
i
am
doing
a
book
reading
and
my
gap
cardigan
suddenly
implodes
into
a
little
pile
of
ash
leaving
me
in
my
bra
in

of
a
large

mumbling
about
how
important
it
is

high
quality

we
can
t
demand
this

product
when
we
as

is

last

don

get
me
wrong
i
m
not
against
being
duped
into
believing
myself
thinner
and
will
quite
happily
pay
for
the
privilege
i
ve
just
yet
to
squeeze
myself
into

anything
i

has
adopted
a

a

it

other
than

port
pretty
much
anywhere
else
you
wind
up
having
to
take
a
boat
or
a
zeppelin
and
i
don
t
exactly
have
a
great
track
record
with
either
one
of
those
plus
then
i
have
to
make
arrangements
to
bring
mortimer
out
there
with
me
because
let
me
tell
you
the
flight
path
options
out
there
are
some
slim
pickings
not
a
whole
lot
of
wyverns
to
choose
from
and
even
the
ones
they
have
aren
t
much
of
a
match
for
the
sturdy
kalimdor
stock
and
beyond
junior
varsity
wyverns
you
ve
got
giant
bats
which
are
a
little
short
on
the
steady
and
a
long
on
the
bitey
for
my
tastes
and
i
m
sorry
there
s
just
no
way
in
you
re
ever
going
to
see
me
riding
around
on
a
dragonhawk
not
least
of
all
because
most
of
them
look
like
they
would
snap
in
two
if
i
ever
actually
sat
on
them
all
well
and
good
checking

what

what

can

tonight
be

that
you

you

sunday
rest
some
details
i
stamped
the
image
several
times
once
on
designer
paper
and
the
other
two
times
on
choice
snow
white
cardstock
te
i
paper
pieced
the
hat
and
apron
from
designer
paper
the
bowl
and
her
hand
from
the
second
image
stamped
on
white
i
used
copic
markers
to
color
the
white
portions
of
the
image
and
to
add
a
touch
of
shading
to
her
apron
and
hat
the
mixing
bowl
needed
a
bit
more
red
to
match
the
rest
of
the
card
so
i
added
little
red
dots
using
the
atyou
spica
glitter
pens
it
soon
becomes
apparent
that
racial
prejudices
know
no
borders
and
while
solomon
works
hard
and
begins
to
experience
some
newfound
freedoms
he
faces
discrimination
and
segregation
and
lives
with
the
ongoing
fear
of
being
caught
by
slavecatchers
and
dragged
back
to
the
south
go
home
take
a
nap
when
you
are
feeling
civilized
again
then
i
will
deal
with
you
please
refer
to
last
week
s
post
titled
in
the
thick
of
things
for
point
of
reference
we
experienced
a
similar
day
yesterday
with
one
huge
difference
everyone
remained
relatively
upbeat
and
calm
let
s
explore
some
of
the
reasons
why
man
this
weekend
went
fast
i
hope
you
enjoyed
yours
and
thank
you
so
much
for
all
the
anniversary
wishes
we
had
a
really
nice
date
night
at
morton
s
home
of
our
first
date
it
was
great
to
have
some
alone
time
and
get
to
talk
and
laugh
uninterrupted
for
several
hours
first
the
authors
so
if
you
would
like
me
to
send
you
a
cute
christmas
card
simply
send
me
your
postal
address
and
i
will
send
you
one
towards
the
end
of
november
i'd
email
your
address
to
me
rather
than
comment
with
it
below
esshaych
hotmail
co
uk
as
you
do
not
want
everyone
seeing
your
address
lol
please
subscribe
and
comment
trying
it
on
it
hit
me
this
product
is
absolutely
ridiculous
i
mean
honestly
you
just
look
silly
with
those
pull
strings
dangling
from
your
ears
then
again
i
do
now
live
in
a
town
where
twice
cutoff
jean
shorts
are
acceptable
and
a
sweatshirt
works
perfectly
fine
in
place
of
a
bra
the
nice
thing
about
going
on
these
trips
is
the
party's
and
the
schmoozing
i
couldn
t
look
myself
in
the
eyes
i
avoided
the
mirror
as
much
as
i
could
when
i
went
in
to
get
a
tissue
i
couldn
t
breathe
and
had
to
blow
my
nose
i
was
starting
to
hyperventilate
it
was
my
own
fault
why
did
i
feel
it
necessary
to
read
that
after
all
i
knew
that
once
i
d
written
about
it
i
was
supposed
to
keep
that
memory
locked
away
in
the
safe
place
put
it
so
far
back
in
my
mind
that
i
could
forget
about
it
enough
to
be
able
to
function
normally
again
i
do
not
have
rocks
and
the
soil
is
not
clay
so
it
runs
smoothly
been
a
few
days
things
are
a
bit
up
in
the
air
at
the
house
of
jelly
at
the
moment
so
it
is
a
card
i
made
last
week
to
show
you
today
it
uses
a
combination
of
goodies
from
the
new
stampin
 
up
summer
mini
catalogue
combined
with
just
as
scrummy
stash
from
the
main
idea
book
and
catalogue
i
have
created
yet
another
pop
up
card
i
have
been
working
as
a
freelance
writer
and
artist
for
the
last
decade
in
that
time
i
have
done
everything
from
ghostwriting
to
toy
design
and
everything
in
between
i
am
currently
working
on
a
novel
series
called
 
myth
 
which
has
held
my
attention
for
the
past
sixteen
years
i
have
spent
my
time
developing
the
world
character
and
story
and
am
now
ready
to
funnel
all
the
preliminary
material
into
the
manuscript
of
the
first
installment
 
of
men
and
monsters
 
so
k
here
you
go
praise
him
for
your
salvation
it
is
important
that
you
use
glossy
cardstock
which
you
can
find
at
your
local
scrapbook
store
there
are
on
line
stores
that
carry
it
too
use
your
search
engine
and
put
in
glossy
cardstock
to
find
a
store
for
you
deep
concern
spiritual
reading
is
to
the
soul
what
food
is
to
the
body
be
careful
therefore
to
select
such
books
as
will
furnish
your
soul
with
the
best
nourishment
i
would
recommend
you
to
become
familiar
especially
with
the
works
of
saint
francis
de
sales
when
the
choice
of
reading
matter
is
made
by
the
advice
of
a
spiritual
director
the
teaching
it
contains
should
be
looked
upon
as
coming
from
the
mouth
of
though
you
would
have
to
work
with
fergie
and
the
awful
black
eyed
peas
if
the
world
really
does
end
according
to
your
prediction
then
i
will
papers
do
not
know
o
has
mild
eczema
he
always
tend
to
break
out
when
the
weather
is
crazy
like
these
few
days
and
i
ve
caught
him
scratching
his
ankle
til
it
becomes
bright
pink
when
i
forgot
to
use
some
lotion
i
know
it
is
pathetic
that
i
stalk
furniture
but
i
do
this
has
been
the
most
random
camera
dumping
post
as
i
get
back
into
the
swing
i
swear
i
ll
be
more
interesting
while
many
slow
flow
bottles
have
still
proven
to
be
too
fast
for
our
little
guy
he
did
not
struggle
at
all
with
the
lansinoh
momma
bottle
with
naturalwavet
peristaltic
but
it
s
not
most
school
chicken
nuggets
have
at
least
a
zillion
ingredients
okay
i
exaggerate
maybe
they
have
thirty
five
modified
corn
starch
soy
beef
extract
and
maltodextrin
among
other
things
are
not
something
i
d
want
any
human
to
have
in
moderation
the
same
goes
for
cupcakes
i
m
not
against
cake
and
i
m
not
against
most
traditions
just
the
last
two
weekends
i
let
my
son
sing
happy
birthday
and
consume
cake
but
it
was
my
choice
i
was
there
to
be
his
judgment
and
he
ate
confections
but
i
also
know
he
s
not
likely
to
eat
cake
for
another
whole
year
the
birthdays
for
the
february
2010
babies
from
my
mommy
groups
are
all
done
and
so
is
the
cake
i
don
t
have
to
worry
about
every
neighborhood
parent
running
down
to
the
local
grocery
and
bringing
a
sugar
corn
syrup
and
white
flour
treat
right
to
his
preschool
desk
may

2012
montreal

petit
campus
i
touched
the
man
s
arm
but
he
shook
my
touch
off
as
if
a
cruel
thing
had
pierced
him
and
when
i
say
masculinity
i
pretty
much
mean
post
war
american
stereotypical
masculinity
if
at
this
point
in
the
season
it
wasn
t
already
clear
to
everyone
this
dawgs
team
is
led
by
aaron
murray
it
s
true
that
he
s
just
a
redshirt
freshman
but
it
s
also
true
that
his
teammates
hold
him
in
high
regard
his
spectacular
play
and
more
importantly
his
toughness
have
endeared
him
to
the
fans
but
don
t
think
these
attributes
have
gone
unnoticed
by
his
teammates
this
is
aaron
s
team
this
is
we
are
truly
blessed
because
we
she
added
the
french
court
has
yet
to
issue
a
subpoena
for
abdul
razak
as
it
has
yet
to
finalise
the
list
of
witnesses
and
that
the
former
could
choose
to
defy
the
court
order
and
not
fall
foul
of
action
by
the
french
authorities

from

angels
i
was
using
an
eagle
industries
external
medical
pouch
from
my
medic
ruck
for
my
ifak
bok
but
it
was
too
big
and
got
in
the
way
whenever
i
dove
to
the
ground
i
switched
it
out
for
a
single
stack
rifle
magazine
pouch
instead
it
holds
a
large
israeli
battle
dressing
a
nasopharyngeal
airway
device
a
chest
punch
needle
and
chest
seal
needle
thoracostomy
for
reduction
of
pneumothorax
issues
and
a
pair
of
nitrile
gloves
it
would
not
hurt
my
feelings
to
add
a
package
of
compressed
gauze
but
i
am
not
overly
concerned
about
lacking
it
either
this
set
up
provides
me
with
enough
gear
to
provide
basic
self
aid
for
most
battlefield
injuries
that
i
am
likely
to
sustain
and
still
be
able
to
treat
to
reiterate
since
the
question
came
up
in
a
class
clinic
recently
your
ifak
bok
is
there
to
treat
you
it
is
not
for
your
buddy
if
he
does
not
have
one
make
him
build
one
build
one
for
him
or
improvise
when
the
time
comes
to
patch
holes
in
him
do
not
use
your
personal
ifak
bok
to
treat
anyone
else
in

to
her

steam
a

to
the

edge
folded
the
hem
under
ironed
it
to
make
the
permanent
bond
then
secured
it
with
a
zig
zag
stitch
can
not
recommend
s
a
s
enough
especially
if
you
are
looking
to
make
a
renfrew
without
that
bottom
band
it
helps
stabilize
the
knit
fabric
so
it
does
not
stretch
out
and
wonkify
under
the
sewing
machine's
presser
foot
i
was
afraid
the
fused
part
would
take
away
the
stretch
of
the
fabric
but
i
found
that
is
not
the
case
seems
like
it
could
work
well
for
unbound
armholes
and
necklines
too
24
i
broke
my
arm
once
well
my
friend
angela
broke
my
arm
playing
soccer
it
was
not
any
fun
i
am
thinking
if
i
would
have
went
to
that
skating
party
tonight
i
could
have
broken
it
again
man
it
is
been
a
long
time
emme
does
he
look
like
an
angel
to
a
question
he
said
stern
action
should
be
taken
against
anyone
involved
in
incidents
of
abduction
for
ransom
because
no
one
was
above
the
law
she
ran
the
downhill
trading
company
which
had
jewelry
and
clothes
and
crafts
of
all
kinds
it
really
made
the
town
quite
famous
at
the
time
and
it
got
written
up
in
one
of
the
newspapers
then
she
helped
run
emilianos
the
clothing
shop
that
was
owned
ava
guitterez
talking
about
names
and
what
we
could
have
been
named
the
below
conversation
has
me
still
cracking
up
paper
dolls
because
the
earth
is
a
spheroid
a
constructive
plate
margin
cannot
extend
at
the
same
speed
at
all
latitudes
therefore
constructive
margins
also
have
a
whole
load
of
transform
strike
slip
faults
which
allow
the
ridge
to
offset
and
accommodate
variable
spreading
rates
there
s
an
example
of
these
from
the
mid
atlantic
ridge
shown
below
these
things
once
formed
remain
as
weaknesses
in
the
oceanic
crust
throughout
its
lifecycle
technically
this
isn
t
a
fix
it
s
a
rebuild
but
nevertheless
it
may
save
you
a
trip
to
the
genius
bar
it
is
amazing
seeing
creative
young
minds
at
work

thought
it
was
fun
just
to
take
the
beads
out
of
their
packages
and
count
them
as
he
put
them
back
in
there
containers
ashlynn
put
alot
of
thought
into
her
colors
and
shapes
as
she
created
this
bracelet
when
she
was
finished
she
beamed
at
me
with
pride
as
i
wrapped
the
finishing
loop
so
she
could
wear
it
she
said
auntie
dawn
my
daddy
is
going
to
be
so
proud
of
me
i
need
to
put
this
in
my
backpack
to
show
him
these
are
the
obvious
ones
though
the
ones
that
stick
out
the
most
the
ones
everyone
looks
at
and
laughs
and
then
wishes
they
had
them
all
people
were
actually
willing
to
support
the
movement
even
including
the
young
male
graduates
here
in
australia
ajak
one
of
the
organizers
of
the
fundraising
encourages
all
young
men
to
get
along
you
men
you
have
to
contribute
these
are
the
girls
whom
you
go
yearly
and
pinch
off
your
wives
among
them
from
overseas
support
us
so
that
we
educated
them
she
said
this
is
an
encouraging
reality
and
that
is
what
he
found
along
with
observing
that
a
significant
fraction
of
moths
found
in
their
natural
daytime
resting
position
35
to
be
exact
were
sitting
on
tree
trunks
as
the
predation
hypothesis
requires
birds
have
to
see
the
moths
to
eat
them
i
took
off
pretty
hard
at
the
start
although
this
was
a
flat
course
the
first
mile
was
ever
so
slightly
downhill
my
garmin
was
showing
paces
around
7
30
which
i
knew
was
too
fast
and
not
sustainable
but
i
thought
i'd
go
with
it
and
see
how
long
i
could
hang
on
mile
1
was
7
47
probably
the
fastest
full
mile
i
have
run
this
year
sad
i
know
in
mile
2
i
settled
down
somewhat
and
i
think
that
one
was
around
8
15
probably
where
it
should
be
one
of
the
things
that
puzzled
me
when
i
first
came
across
the
design
of
the
cell
was
how
both
cathode
and
anode
are
lead
in
most
electrochemical
cells
there
are
dissimilar
materials
i
am
sure
you
have
seen
nicad
or
nickle
cadmium
for
example
zinc
carbon
the
most
common
batteries
in
your
local
store
zinc
manganese
dioxide
alkaline
batteries
and
silver
zinc
are
other
common
chemistries
one
side
is
positive
the
other
negative
in
lead
acid
batteries
both
sides
are
lead
never

did
not

i
remember
the
night
he
was
conceived
if
he
ever
asks
what
kid
wants
i
know
this
but
hey
he
might
one
day
i
can
tell
him
that
it
was
passionate
and
i
have
fond
memories

no
one
has
the
art
of
socialization
down
and
i
don
t
think
anyone
ever
will
each
person
you
interact
with
is
just
so
different
each
shaped
by
his
or
her
past
relationship
experiences
a
book
i
recently
read
described
socializing
with
someone
new
as
taking
a
risk
i
think
this
comparison
has
some
truth
to
it
a
person
can
either
stage
2
contact
and
inform
consumers
2
you
must
link
it
to
mr
linky
if
you
have

problem
feel
free
to
email
me
i
will
help
you
link
it
for
the
trifle
watching
michelle
obama
hula
hooping
plunged
me
back
to
my
childhood
we
had
a
hula
hoop
craze
in
the
congo
too
and
i
was
pretty
good
at
it
i
was
called
a
for
that
for
hula
hooping
was
considered
a
girl's
thing
but
i
m
sure
that
the
new
congolese
generation
of
both
genders
would
certainly
pick
it
up
if
it
weren
t
for
the
prohibitive
costs
though
it
d
be
easy
to
make
hula
hoops
with
rattan
or
palm
tree
branches
i
do
not
know
why
but
michelle
obama's
hula
hoop
swivels
made
me
think
she'd
be
good
at
congolese
dance
based
roughly
on
the
same
principle
thinking
points
a
i
had
two
very
good
reasons
first
i
am
replaceable
and
you
are
not
its
a
good
thing
that
we
talked
about
this
cause
we
could
not
of
been
further
apart
from
one
another
i
was
thinking
that
hers
was
going
to
involve
a
specific
place
time
of
year
maybe
some
romance
and
feelings
probably
some
candles
or
potpourri
ok
shut
it
i
read
cosmo
a
visit
to
target
face
after
years
of
doing
that
i
became
pregnant
so
a
new
chapter
of
my
life
and
my
writing
was
to
begin
i
went
back
to
work
at
the
end
of
my
maternity
leave
and
decided
i
couldn
t
be
away
from
our
son
all
day
and
miss
out
on
his
young
life
so
my
husband
and
i
decided
that
i
would
be
a
stay
at
home
mom
and
i
turned
in
my
resignation
of
the
flock
is
not
he
just
the
cutest
little
guy
i
stole
him
he
was
a
freebee
and
if
i
use
him
i
should
give
credit
to
the
artist
however
i
can
not
find
where
i
got
him
i
can
not
even
find
him
anywhere
on
my
hard
drive
so
i
can
not
give
the
artist
the
credit
he
she
so
deserves
so
i
stole
him
if
you
want
to
add
a
little
extra
topper
stick
a
few
flowers
or
ribbon
at
top
of
the
tree
i
used
artificial
poinsettias
because
i
had
them
on
hand
i
could
have
used
hydrangeas
but
i
did
not
have
any
leftover
sometimes
you
gotta
use
what
you
have
two
brothers
philip
and
bartholomew
my
third
thesis
brings
me
around
to
one
of
john
s
titles
the
apostle
of
love
there
is
nothing
so
guaranteed
to
produce
lengthy
outbursts
of
praise
complete
with
lots
of
repetition
as
love
john
possessed
of
childlike
vitality
and
sagacious
patience
was
possessed
by
love
see
what
kind
of
love
the
father
has
given
to
us
he
says
in
one
place
in
astonishment
and
we
love
because
he
first
loved
us
5
he
is
love
s
contemplative
and
he
cannot
help
but
turn
over
and
over
in
his
mind
the
glory
the
steadfast
love
and
the
faithfulness
of
as
it
was
perfected
in
his
dear
friend
jesus
of
nazareth
i
want
to
like
this
school
but
it
is
hard
to
like
something
that
tells
you
that
you
re
okay
because
you
re
great
but
you
re
not
great
often
enough
the
cupcakes
are
okay
i
found
them
to
be
bland
in
taste
that
s
great
if
you
re
baking
them
for
the
kids
especially
for
our
little
picky
eaters
for
adults
they
need
an
extra
zip
of
spice
this
was
a
fun
recipe
to
try
and
a
nice
treat
but
not
the
kind
of
thing
i
am
likely
to
make
eat
all
the
time
one
can
only
eat
so
much
salad
to
balance
out
such
things
but
this
next
recipe
is
something
i
am
adding
to
my
repertoire
forever
another
atk
recipe
i
am
such
a
fangirl
this
time
for
their
rustic
dinner
rolls
i
guess
i
have
got
a
little
confidence
in
my
bread
making
skills
since
my
successful
boule
experiment
and
dinner
rolls
seemed
like
a
good
fit
since
unlike
a
large
loaf
these
can
be
frozen
and
individually
defrosted
as
needed
i
hate
throwing
food
away
and
i
think
i
would
cry
if
i
had
to
throw
away
lovingly
homemade
bread
because
it
went
stale
unfortunately
no
pictures
of
the
process
i
got
a
migraine
halfway
through
making
these
my
wonderful
boyfriend
took
over
and
turned
the
dough
according
to
the
recipe
while
i
took
my
medication
and
laid
in
a
dark
room
for
a
while
but
the
outcome
wow
the
programme
acts
as
a
safety
net
for
children
and
an
incentive
for
households
to
send
their
children
to
school
instead
of
getting
them
to
work
to
help
feed
the
family
it
further
establishes
schools
as
interventions
benefiting
the
entire
community

my
grandfather
is
the
minister
we
attended
their
last
event
and
it
was
lovely
prior
to
attending
you
learn
know
an
appropriate
song
either
on
your
own
or
collaboratively
and
perform
in
the
church
i
was
expecting
epic
music
failure
but
a
woman
sang
a
heartwrenching
a
capella
there
was
a
classical
musician
who
performed
a
mozart
piece
note
perfect
and
the
academic
after
much
prodding
from
me
exploded
my
heart
by
getting
up
and
singing
an
old
gospel
spiritual
song
completely
a
capella
it
was
one
of
those
moments
in
life
where
you
are
just
watching
something
incredible
unfold
and
you
are
just
sitting
there
awestruck
come
along
you
do
not
have
to
be
christian
but
if
you
are
not
respectful
i
will
smack
the
heck
out
of
you
in
addition
according
to
an
emarketer
report
u
s
local
online
ad
spending
is
also
expected
to
grow
anywhere
from
8
to
18
annually
so
if
the
publication
has
a
local
website
that
may
also
be
a
viable
spot
for

at
all

it
certainly
does

this

this
is
serious
business
and
pay
no

to

behind

i
don
t
really
know
that
much
about
shuppet
otherwise
i
ve
never
owned
one
nor
encountered
one
in
the
wild
his
plots
tend
to
be
simple
either
mysteries
or
routine
adventures
but
you
do
not
read
vance
fiction
for
the
plots
but
rather
to
explore
his
wondrous
worlds
and
spend
time
with
the
fascinating
people
occasionally
though
a
vance
story
does
have
a
plot
worthy
of
its
setting
or
even
a

provoking
theme
the

of
koryphon

such
a

so
is
one

construction
costs
are

because
almost
all

plus

my
ongoing
family
history
research
another
public
list
i
ve
created
is
stories
and
documents
kept
at
the
internet
archive
site
one
of
them
is
a
short
biography
on
the
amazing
life
of
benjamin
henry
latrobe
he
s
a
distant
cousin
and
while
a
documentary
has
been
done
about
him
a
full
feature
movie
would
be
appropriate
we
re
diametrically
opposed
to
using
backing
tracks
live
so
yes
the
live
show
has
different
energy
and
a
different
chemistry
some
of
the
overdubs
will
be
missing
but
that
s
nothing
different
to
what
the
stones
did
in
the
60s
meet
jack
jack's
a
zombie
jack
loves
his
wife
who
is
not
a
zombie
he
would
never
do
anything
to
hurt
her
but
oh
do
her
brains
smell
good
it
s
my
weakness
to
expect
truthful
relationship
but
once
i
was
reminded
that
it
s
also
my
strength
in
that
conversation
he
started
out
with
i
do
not
think
i
love
you
after
awhile
it
was
i
love
you
but
i
am
not
happy
then
it
was
i
love
you
but
i
am
scared
no
one
has
ever
depended
on
me
i
need
to
be
alone
i
know
he
is
not
in
a
good
place
i
know
he
loves
me
this
was
completely
out
of
the
blue
we
had
just
gotten
back
the
day
before
from
an
amazing
camping
trip
where
we
both
had
a
fantastic
time
laughing
much
of
the
time
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
just
us
had
what
i
consider
the
best
of
our
relationship
the
night
before
this
all
happened
he
was
the
one
saying
i
love
you
first
on
the
phone
we
had
had
a
small
disagreement
about
something
and
i
was
being
quiet
he
kept
repeating
i
love
you
till
i
said
it
back
now
he
will
not
even
say
i
love
you
recipe
he
expands
on
how
to
apply
this
rule
on
the
continuum
of
soft
magic
to
hard
magic
just
like
in
sf
there
is
the
continuum
of
soft
science
to
hard
science
he
uses
spiderman
gandalf
and
harry
potter
as
specific
examples
but
also
mentions
several
authors
who
have
approached
magic
in
ways
differently
from
himself
yet
he
still
enjoys
reading
their
stories
so
sweet
and
juicy
going
down
followed
by
a
drying
slightly
peppery
bitterness
and
a
toasted
finish
another
one
that
will
not
blow
you
away
but
it
is
certainly
a
nice
one
to
have
a
few
of
on
a
night
i
think
i
still
like
it
that
is
the
basic
gist
of
the
story
but
de
palma
tries
to
dress
it
up
with
his
use
of
multiple
styles
unfortunately
the
result
is
an
interminable
mess
de
palma's
asides
with
a
group
of
french
documentarians
parody
stuffy
emptily
moralistic
war
docs
the
camera
slowly
zooming
in
and
out
on
soldiers
 
faces
as
the
orchestral
arrangement
of
sarabande
from
barry
lyndon
plays
at
least
i
assume
it
is
a
parody
these
segments
are
so
tedious
that
de
palma
must
be
making
fun
of
such
films
but
his
target
is
unclear
likewise
we
see
various
youtube
clips
of
terrorists
sneaking
bombs
under
the
clueless
eyes
of
the
americans
or
of
newscasts
showing
angry
iraqis
swearing
vengeance
for
what
has
happened
to
them
everyone
knows
what
the
americans
are
doing
but
no
one
will
listen
the
 
charge
is
based
on
the
loss
incurred
by
us
this
claim
is
absolutely
baffling
what
loss
the
author
pays
elm
publishing
to
publish
their
book
then
charges
them
for
returned
books
it
claims
can
not
sic
be
delivered
because
they
are
destroyed
in
the
wholesale
network
to
keep
the
costs
low
to
keep
whose
costs
low
it
certainly
is
not
the
authors
they
are
paying
for
books
pulped
at
the
distributors
in
my
head
my
job
has
never
been
my
number
one
priority

kids
self
intentional
family
and
so
on
are
the
items
floating
back
and
forth
up
and
down
in
that
top
5
bracket
but
i
was
living
my
life
as
if
my
job
was
a
top
priority
as
well
as
keeping
my
heartfelt
priorities
at
the
top
too
no
wonder
i
was
so
stressed
and
worn
out
and
frustrated
and
cranky

this

actually

matthew
thank
you
for
your
contribution
to
a
free
and
independent
nonduality
i
like
how
you
go
outside
the
box
to
find
artists
and
others
to
feature
on
your
site
i
feel
that
s
important
because
it
can
be
easy
to
interview
only
the
current
crop
of
accepted
nondual
personalities
so
keep
up
the
good
work
and
thank
you
for
inviting
me
to
appear
on
your
website
what
kind
of
poetry
do
you
write
i
write
eclectically
i
m
drawn
to
short
form
but
i
can
spin
a
yarn
now
and
then
i
love
to
play
with
words
and
syllabic
forms
i
break
the
rules
more
often

not

i
struggle
with
and
try
to
explore
ways
of
describing
poetry
is
a
way
of
existing
and
hemingway
s
book
a
moveable
feast
i
thought
it
was
endlessly
fascinating
to
read
about
the
way
he
and
his
fellow
writers
and
artists
lived
during
that
time
i
couldn
t
turn
the
pages
fast
enough
waiting
in
line
at
the
castro
theater
at
sofia
s
usual
chinese
restaurant
mi
roo
is
about
to
dig

food
when

her

she
takes
a

he
needs
to
know
what
she
thinks
about
his

she
finds
it
moving

the

theologians
and
christians
who
wish
to
deepen

count
on

intelligence

must
cultivate
a

experience
of
faith
at

simple

faribault
s
connection
to
the
fur
trade
and
native
americans
stretches
back
to
its
founding
by
fur
trader
alexander
faribault
the
son
of
a
french
canadian
fur
trader
and
a
dakota
woman
faribault
traded
with
native
americans
in
the
area
later
he
would
be
involved
in
negotiating
land
treaties
between
the
government
and
the
dakota
he
was
persecuted
and
recanted
but
it
still
stands
as
an
example
of
how
we
can
become
homogenous
again
safe
from
imported
gang
murders
muggings
and
muslim
bomb
attacks
civilisation
is
created
by
effort
and
genius
and
must
be
renewed
daily
but
is
being
undermined
by
our
rulers
for
a
new
world
order
through
studying
history
we
learn
that
civilisations
decline
and
fall
when
they
become
decadent
and
the
people
indulgent
as
in
egypt
and
rome
which
is
why
history
is
being
phased
out
of
state
education
people
expect
the
state
to
solve
their
problems
and
spoiling
them
makes
them
dependent
for
not
only
material
needs
but
their
beliefs
which
are
provided
by
the
media
and
opinion
formers
so
they
become
decadent
and
indulgent
discrimination
against
us
is
presented
as
moral
superiority
affirmative
action
we
who
have
emotionally
bonded
with
our
people
and
territory
and
belong
here
are
being
dispossessed
by
our
rulers
for
unrealistic
hopes
of
one
world
and
those
they
brought
here
as
cheap
labour
it
takes
totalitarianism
to
make
disparate
groups
unite
and
our
lives
are
being
increasingly
regulated
a
hospital
visit
needs
a
password
and
our
confidential
relations
with
our
g
p
s
have
been
destroyed
now
that
our
personal
medical
histories
are
put
on
a
national
database
we
are
becoming
state
property
the
enlightened
ruling
and
cultural
elites
try
to
dismiss
our
views
as
prejudice
but
when
examined
their
views
are
rationalisations
of
their
prejudice
in
favour
of
other
ethnic
groups

you
make

well
as

my

thinks
she
has
the
ability
to
make
me
call
her
because
sometimes
when
she
thinks
of
me
i
do
call
her
but
i
call
her
all
the
time

three
recent
pieces
on
the
consulting

that

philanthropy
and

caught
my
attention
the
chronicle
of

ran
this
piece
noting
some
of
the
bigger

firms
it
also
noted
that
the
services
these

provide
used
to
be
offered
up

now
they
are

side
of

that
are
the
most
developed
the
most

the
most
sophisticated
and
for
obvious
reasons
also
the
most
cunning
and
the
most
secret
the
true
nature
of
their
offensive
techniques
and
the
high
level
of
sophistication
involved
are
never
and
i
repeat
never
made
known
to
the
general
populace
this
is
why
i
never
report
on
matters
related
to
the
so
called

of

as
the

they
share
with

the

can

how
very
she
must
be

no
one
goes
around
telling
people
they
are

the
prettiest
people
around
since
the
novel
is
in

these
critical
people
are
speaking
to
her

or
within

that
she
needs
a

we

has

a

may

it

oh
msfs
how
i
have
come
to
love
thee
i
was
not
one
to
bother
with
highlighting
but
ever
since
i
got
laura
mercier's
illuminator
i
have
become
a
bit
obsessed
the
natural
progression
led
me
to
mac's

while
there
are
many
many
msfs
most
are
limited
edition
there
are
two
in
the
core
collection
one
of
which
being
soft
and
gentle
this
area
has
turned
into
a
sort
of
wishing
pond
for
tourists
but
i
did
not
because
on
one
of
our
daily
outings
last
thursday
he
led
me
into
the
woods
at
overton
park
on
his
own
and
then
sunday
he
surprised
me
again
the
verse
is
followed
by
another
guitar
bass
riff
starting
with
the
same
descending
third
heard
in
the
opening
riff
but
transposed
up
a
major
third
c
down
to
a
the
riff
then
involves
a
higher
f
in
a
descending
line
moving
down
to
the
low
f
showing
us
now
that
these
notes
are
actually
spelling
out
an
augmented
chord
f
a
c
f
the
last
two
bars
of
this
three
bar
riff
are
actually
the
same
two
bars
that
were
heard
at
the
beginning
of
the
song
thus
setting
up
the
second
verse
in
the
same
manner
as
the
first
i
love
how
they
have
paired
the
opalescent
blue
with
the
gold
motif
it
looks
quite
striking
and
classy
it
is
sure
to
get
someones
attention
with
the
beautiful
colors
what
a
true
word
what
we
worship
we
become
even
when
we
worship
and
what
danger
because
when
we
worship
a
false
a
broken
an
imperfect
image
of
those
imperfections
themselves
get
imprinted
on
our
faith
do
you
believe
is
cruel
and
harsh
you
are
likely
to
be
cruel
and
harsh
do
you
believe
is

you
are
likely
to
be
unforgiving
yourself
do
you
believe
is
an
abstraction
of
power
you
are
likely
to
find
yourself
worshipping
power
in
all
its
forms
do
you
think
is
love
in
such
a
way
that
you
could
also
say
love
is

spending

a

over

my
life
is
a
living
testimony
that
he

his

through

when
we
make
him
our

treasure
as
we
spend

with
him
he
reveals
to
us
the
desires
of
his
heart
and
they
become
our
own
desires
he
reveals
to
us
his
plans

us
to
walk
in
them
the
great

my
daughter
is
almost
twelve
and
like
all
tween
girls
she
is
lacking
direction
in
certain
areas
becoming
increasingly
frustrated
with
the
fact
that
she
doesn
t
listen
to
me
at
all
i
decided
that
i
would
capitalize
on
her
love
of
reading
to
get
my
point
across
on
certain
key
issues
so
a
couple
of
nights
ago
she
and
i
headed
out
to
c
w
used
books
to
get
a
couple
of
publications
that
deal
with
tween
issues
as
we
were
exiting
the
drama
angst
section
the
fruit
of
my
asked
if
i
was
getting
any
literature
for
my
own
personal
growth
seeing
as
the

self
help
section
was

next
to

he
views
them
from

of
a

is
it
easy
to

is
it
accessible
enough
there
should
be
a

arc
and
a

ending
he
loves
to
see
a
type
symmetry
in
the
story
e
g
when
the
beginning
and
the
end
happen
in
the

place
it
would
be
like
the

has
come
round
full

the
text
does
not
have

in

it
is

it

not

it
s
also
the

who
don

there
s

a

the

that
morning
his

to
have
four
children
with
the
youngest
about
four
months
old
hurrah
for
mrs

and
her
list
of
infinite
invention
i
am
a
fussy
to
buy
for
when
it
comes
to
christmas
and
birthdays
yet
on
every
occasion
she
comes
up
with
some
kind
of
wonderful
sometimes
when
transferring
birthday
dates
into
a
new
diary
i
can
barely
remember
who
some
of
the
people
are
but
if
i
were
ever
to
meet
them
again
i
would
be
able
to
impressively
know
when
their
birthdays
are
that
s
when
i
threw
in
my
shovel
and
scrambled
after
her
i
hurriedly
mixed
a
fresh
drink
of
mango
lassi
hoping
to
distract
her
before
she
took
it
upon
herself
to

oddly
i
ve
been
asked
three
times
for
media
comment
on
that
but
none
of
it
has
appeared
if
you
re
interested
in
my
opinion
you
may
have
to
wait
until
i
put
it
up
here
which
i
rather
think
i
will
some
time
this
week
everything
that
i
used
for
the
recipe
can
be
seen
above
i
made
sure
to
get
pure
pressed
juice
that
did
not
have
any
preservatives
as
this
does
not
agree
with
the
yeast
too
well
apparently
it
was
not
that
much
expensive
than
the
concentrate
so
all
was
fine
there
after
a
scrumptious
dinner
some
of
the
elder
friends
went
home
and
i
do
say
that
lovingly
it
was
their
choice
while
the
rest
of
us
went

blurb
a
lively
book
illustrated
with
archival
photos
secrets
of
lake
simcoe
is
a
valuable
addition
to
local
history
collections
and
provides
a
refreshing
way
for
anyone
to
view
what
some
consider
to
be
canada
s
sixth
great
lake
at
the
heart
of
central
ontario
lake
simcoe
has
played
an
important
role
in
the
province
s
history
for
hundreds
of
years
today
a
popular
destination
for
pleasure
seekers
and
cottagers
it
helped
open
up
the
region
to
explorers
and
fur
traders
settlers
and
entrepreneurs
the
lake
has
secrets
aplenty
and
this
book
offers
a
selection
of
stories
of
dramatic
episodes
from
the
lake
s
past
there
are
shipwrecks
stately
resorts
vanished
industries
forgotten
forts
and
even
most
foul
the
mentor
shadow
program
should
be
obvious
in
a
country
this
large
we
need
to
develop
as
many
top
level
coaches
in
every
discipline
that
we
can
across
the
nation
i
would
even
look
to
develop
regional
coaches
directories
along
with
regional
coaching
development
programs
that
put
coaches
like
john
smith
alberto
salazar
bobby
kersee
and
booth
together
with
their
peers
to
exchange
information
techniques
this
should
be
mandatory
for
all
coaches
who
want
to
work
on
international
programs
because
we
want
to
replicate
their
success
we
want
as
many
athletes
as
possible
benefiting
from
their
knowledge
similarly
the
athlete
referral
program
would
take
elite
athletes
and
put
them
in
touch
with
coaches
that
can
help
shore
up
their
weaknesses
for
example
while
a
walter
dix
has
his
own
coach
he
and
his
coach
could
be
referred
to
jon
drummond
for
analysis
and
tweaking
of
his
start
mechanics
again
without
disrespect
to
their
personal
coaches
acceptance
of
referrals
should
almost
be
a
mandatory
component
of
competing
on
international
teams
as
we
want
those
athletes
competing
in
the
red
white
and
blue
competing
at
their
absolute
maximum
potential
but
then
he
goes
from
harsh
truth
to
complete
delusion
yeah
well
you
know
since
high
school
this
last
bit
of
course
is
not
good
news
so
i
lied
i
ended
up
with
more
bad
news
but
there
is
hope
as
long
as
there
is
any
good
news
to
report
amidst
the
reams
of
bad
news
at
least
as
it
is
perceived
by
those
who
worry
about
the
planet
we
are
supposed
to
care
for
then
i
stopped
by
to
see
a
friend
who
lives
in
long
beach
we
walked
his
dog
grabbed
a
bite
to
eat
it
ended
up
all
over
my
hands
and
clothes
but
was
so
good
and
looked
at
vacation
pictures
and
it
just
keeps
on
going
next
week
a
girlfriend
from
college
who
i
have
not
seen
in
years
is
coming
up
with
her
girls
and
we
are
going
to
the
observatory
and
i
have
plans
to
see
eat
pray
love
and
probably
winter's
bone
with
another
couple
friends
lots
of
fun
going
on
here
but
not
a
lot
of
picture
taking
sorry
about
that
ms
learoyd
added
fostering
is
a
great
way
for
people
to
have
the
enjoyment
of
being
around
youngsters
whilst
helping
us
out
in
the
short
term
just
like
teenagers
these
young
horses
need
experience
of
life
a
day
to
day
routine
and
a
guiding
hand
being
a
fosterer
is
a
really
rewarding
experience
you
can
see
these
youngsters
personalities
change
and
develop
as
they
grow
you
are
required
to
do
study
on
things
like
what
amount
of
competition
will
come
up
whether
the
market
is
saturated
or
not
what
do
consumers
of
this
market
look
into
etc
knowing
the
environment
in
which
you
think
your
business
and
you
will
be
functioning
will
be
helpful
in
equipping
your
business
with
necessary
tools
that
are
required
to
make
online
business
success
just
to
see
that
smile
light
up
your
face
well
let
me
say
this
londoners
it
up
i
feel
no
sympathy
for
you
at
all
when
i
was

year
old

facing
10

to
be
culturally
correct
the
underprivileged
who
would
quite
happily
chop
me
into
little
pieces
with
their
panga's
machete's
you
were
campaigning
for
their
equal
rights
you
were
imposing
sanctions
on
us
you
were
screaming
how
they
were
equal
on
the
social
ladder
and
you
were
telling
us
how
all
men
are
equal
wrap
each
piece
loosely
in
a
piece
of
aluminum
foil
place
the
foil
packets
in
a
steamer
and
steam
for
30
minutes
if
you
are
making
more
than
4
packets
you
might
want
to
do
this
in
batches
so
the
steamer
isn
t
too
crowded
and
each
packet
has
room
to
expand
when
the
steaks
cool
transfer
them
to
the
refrigerator
for
at
least
an
hour
but
preferably
overnight
in

just
frustrated
the
lamb

foreseen
from

and
spoken
of
in
the

of
eden
was
not
actually
slain
much
before

but
his
glory
was
praised
by
all
the
holy
prophets
who
through
the
holy
spirit
preached
of
the
coming
of
messiah
in
the

his
coming
in

was
the

the

indeed
was
slain

the
enjoyment
factor
of
this
show
it
may
not
have
been
obvious
throughout
the
review
but
i
loved
watching
this
show
it
is
easily
the
best
so
bad
it
s
good
thing
i
ve
watched
in
a
long
long
while
the
trainwreck
attraction
of
this
was
absolutely
glorious
you
just
don
t
get
one
on
this
scale
like
ever
the
awful
characters
the
nonsensical
plot
the
contrived
twists
all
of
it
combined
to
make
guilty
crown
outstandingly
hilarious
adding
to
the
big
joke
that
is
this
series
is
just
how
high
profile
it
was
the
staff
lineup
the
budget
the
studio
the
fact
that
it
s
a
noitamina
series
airing
over
two
seasons
which
so
rarely
happens
with
noitamina
it
looked
so
set
to
be
a
massive
massive
thing
and
seeing
it
fail
this
hard
was
absolutely
hilarious
i
m
glad
i
got
to
watch
it
as
it
aired
and
i
m
sad
to
see
it
go
because
i
ll
never
get
to
see
something
as
bad
as
guilty
crown
in
this
way
for
a
long
long
time
and
now
nearly
17
years
later
i
can
still
hear
grandpa

still
smell

still
shiver
at
the

of
how
cold
those

were

forever
etched

my

were
telling
me

history
repeats
itself
the
guardian
reports
the
greek
president
has
summoned
the
leaders
of
the
country
s
three
largest
parties
to
a
meeting
on
sunday
in
a
final
attempt
to
forge
a
unity
government
and
avoid
another
election
however
that
might
not
be
the
full
story
even
if
the
report
then
goes
on
to
point
out
that
he
will
also
be
meeting
with
the
leaders
of
the
fringe
parties
and
in
the
greek
press
we
can
read
that
after
meeting
new
democracy
s
antonis
samaras
syriza
s
alexis
tsipras
and
pasok
s
evangelos
venizelos
he
will
then
have
separate
meetings
with
the
leaders
of
the
other
four
parties
in
the
new
parliament
panos
kammenos
of
independent
greeks
aleka
papariga
of
the
communist
party
nikos
michaloliakos
of
golden
dawn
and
fotis
kouvelis
of
the
democratic
left
the
negative
elite
have
hit
bottom
what
happens
from
here
is
anyone
s
guess
but
let
us
all
hope
for
a
quick
surrender
so
that
more
lives
are
not
lost
local
initiative
is
stifled
most
management
effort
is
now
directed
into
moving
paperwork
up
and
down
the
chain
until
a
link
across
to
the
relevant
national
functional
silo
can
be
found

buckpassing
becomes
an
artform
it
s
a
little
like
a
training
session
i
once
attended
i
was
told
this
very
effective
thing
that
i
still
smile
about
today
it
s
simply
when
somebody
is
pointing
at
you
one
finger
points
towards
you
and
3
point
directly
back
at
them
so
whatever
they
re
shouting
about
more
of
it
is
about
them
not
you
try
it
sometime
a
few
weeks
ago
we
did
have
some
snow
although
january
was
far
too
disappointing
in
that
aspect
o
a
friend
and
i
are
planning
on
meeting
weekly
and
have
themed
short
story
writing
nights
could
be
fun
could
be
a
total
flop
sounds
fun
worth
a
try
we
ll
see
but
i
honestly
just
don
t
write
enough
short
stories
i
should
they
re
good
practice
but
i
don
t
and
i
intend
to
change
that
i
have
a
lot
of
ideas
already
which
is
a
good
sign
add
the
remaining
egg
mixture
in
3
additions
scraping
down
the
bowl
after
each
addition
and
beating
for
2
minutes
afterwards
he
delivered
a
blow
to
the
green
knight
that
sent
him
stumbling
to
the
side
without
any
weapons
to
defend
himself
a
snowman
seemed
to
be
the
most
popular
play
doh
creation
especially
amongst
the
boys
i
met
her
in
1998
the
day
after
my
first
horse
had
died
that
is
why
i
remember
so
clearly
when
she
walked
into
my
life
commenters
to
the
site
took
issue
because
gothamist
makes
frequent
postings
about
street
artists
who
in
the
opinion
of
the
commenters
are
vandals
themselves
a
few
miles
east
of
taylor

house

s
green
two
story
home
where
he
lives
with
his
wife
and
two
daughters
is
also
stuck
behind
the
border
wall
he
agrees
that
the
fence
is
not
solving
anything
driving
in
his
truck
along
the
fence
this
week
he
pointed
out
several
places
where
scuffmarks
suggested
that
people
had
recently
climbed
over
on
one
part
of
the
fence
not
too
far
from
his
house
a
torn
shirt
hung
from
the
top
of
a
pole
we
are
counseled
to
not
be
a
sign
seeking
people
as
this
story
is
of
seeking
a
sign
but
i
think
there
is
wisdom
in
remembering
that
our
father
is
a
of
miracles
you
are
not
writing
down
what
we
have
really
eaten
for
dinner
this
week
are
you
i
am
glad
this
bm
got
me
try
those
recipes
and
what
of
our
livelihoods
please
help
us
fuazan
said
how
are
we
supposed
to
support
ourselves
now
that
we
ve
been
brought
here
winding
across
wide
water
without
sound
it
should
have
been
a
disaster
but
luckily
our
friend
candy
gourlay
author
of
the
fabulous
tall
story
came
along
and
took
command
of
the
filming
and
directing
so
it
is
thanks
to
candy
that
we
produced
something
reasonably
coherent
and
we
hope
entertaining
p
s
compare
with
this
story
on
bet
el's
ulpana
neighborhood
and
i
think
you
can
see
how
straightforward
this
was
no
schmaltz
but
the
story
with
almost
all
around
balance
with
quotes
from
all
angles
oaa
testing
the
next
week
s
oaa
testing
schedule
is
listed
below
remember
that
it
is
very
important
that
students
are
in
school
on
scheduled
testing
dates
i
appreciate
how
hard
that
students
and
parents
have
worked
to
have
students
to
school
and
on
time
during
last
week
s
testing
our
attendance
was
wonderful
his
male
perspective
and
wit
drew
me
in
in
a
large
bowl
combine
greens
gouda
apple
and
turkey
serve
plain
or
dressed
with
your
favorite
dressing
going
forward
take
no
usury
or
interest
from
him
but
fear
your
that
your
brother
may
live
with
you
i
must
say
for
a
change
i
have
found
a
blog
whose
navigation
i
actually
like
as
i
mentioned
earlier
the
slide
show
widget
is
a
nice
one
providing
glimpses
of
the
wonderful
photos
the
popular
posts
and
archives
provide
another
option
what
i
like
best
is
the
use
of
labels
the
labels
have
been
used
creatively
to
create
a
species
list
it
provides
a
very
useful
reference
for
anyone
looking
to
identify
fauna
related
post
and
search
widgets
can
give
additional
navigation
options
but
navigation
is
good
as
it
is
also
beyond
a
certain
point
anymore
of
it
might
not
add
too
much
value
how
has
the
holy
spirit
developed
your
passion
for
christ
apologies
for
the
bad
quality
of
the
photograph
but
my
ipod
camera
is
awful
as
the
title
suggests
over
the
last
few
weeks
i
ve
been
quilting
against
the
clock
my
nephew
is
due
to
be
born
in
just
over
two
weeks
and
this
partly
made
quilt
will
be
for
him
or
her
if
the
scan
was
wrong
the
notice
caused
quite
a
stir
in
the
media
and
online
and
the
irish
examiner
was
keen
to
find
out
how
the
people
of
dublin
felt
about
the
controversy
so
suitably
eh
inappropriately
attired
in
a
navy
blue
pyjama
top
and
red
tartan
bottoms
i
donned
my
grey
bathrobe
put
on
a
newly
acquired
pair
of
pink
slippers
and
took
to
the
streets
of
the
capital
to
ask
around
one
thing
is
for
sure
we
have
some
mighty
heroic
people
who
did
not
build
the
reactors
firefighters
we
re
both
excited
motivated
and
diligently
writing
yay
adi

mahala
i
we
are
now
running
out
of
time
and
the
question
now
is
not
what
is
happening
to
the
climate
but
how
bad
will
it
be
before
the
world
starts
doing
enough

for
no

today
we
will
think
about
something
else
in
this
encounter
between
elijah
and
and
that
is
sometimes
we
must
take
care
of
physical
needs
before
a
spiritual
encounter
with
elijah
had
wandered
into
the
desert
he
needed
rest
food
and
water
sent
a
messenger
or
an
angel
to
bake
a
cake
and
to
provide
water
and
then
instructed
elijah
to
rise
and
eat
then
the
angel
told
him
to
eat
again
because
the
journey
was
going
to
be
difficult
and
the
calves
while
not
exactly
upset
with
me
did
give
me
the
eye
they
know
that
their
other
place
provided
them
with
shelter
from
the
rain
and
i
don
t
unfortunately
according
to
her
she
has
no
talent
or
is
yet
to
find
out
her
talent
well
i
believe
she
has
and
she
sure
has
not
discovered
it
yet
but
where
is
it
the
commissioner
who
however
they
were
also
playing
like
a
bunch
of
goons
the
hacks
the
slashes
the
taunts
the
shots
to
the
head
the
tripping
it
was
unbelievable
or
well
i
guess
not
considering
the
fact
that
the
officials
in
these
games
have
chosen
to
continually
look
the
other
way
until
a
crucial
moment
in
the
game
and
then
they
would
blatantly
favour
the
bruins
did
anyone
tell
me
sure
clown

can
t
talk
or
widen
their
eyes
for
comic
effect
but
they
can
do
cooler
things
like

do
not
allow
the
common
perception
of
meetings
to
impede
your
desire
to
improve
the
professionalism
until
such
times
as
you
run
meetings
you
will
not
be
able
to
affect
the
overall
effectiveness
but
you
can
practice
all
of
the
attributes
that
you
will
need
in
the
future
if
you
arrive
at
meetings
with
this
mindset
not
only
will
you
be
able
to
practice
in
a
very
safe
environment
these
attributes
but
such
enthusiasm
and
professionalism
will
certainly
be
noticed
by
more
senior
members
of
your
company
be
positive
in
meetings
and
use
them
for
your
own
growth
and
i
promise
you
even
the
worst
run
meeting
that
you
attend
will
be
a
success
for
you
i
was
so
sad
about
it
of
course
the
back
of
the
box
has
a
description
of
all
the
characters
as
well
as

kind

like

idea
that

would
only
have
about
15

the
overture
was
another
case
in
point
its
opening
gravely
beethovenian
despite
the
difference
in
tempo
and
almost
everything
else
i
was
somehow
put
in
mind
of
coriolan
an
unfortunate
split
horn
note
was
heard
upon
the
horns
entry
but
thereafter
throughout
the
work
the
lso
s
horns
were
on
excellent
form
just
as
required
in
this
of
all
operas
there
was
a
sense
of
fairy
tale
i
thought
of
davis
s
h
nsel
und
gretel
for
the
royal
opera
but
there
was
also
and
increasingly
so
wagnerian
gravity
to
be
heard
reminding
us
that
so
many
times
in
this
work
siegfried
is
but
a
stone
s
throw
away
fafner
s
lair
takes
form
in
the
wolf
s
glen
scene
and
there
was
no
shortage
of
dramatic
drive
to
the
conclusion
of
the
overture
but
davis
and
his
wonderful
orchestra
saw
no
reason
to
resort
to
anything
hinting
at
superficial
display
orchestral
malevolence
was
to
be
heard
in
spades
at
the
opening
of
kaspar
s
aria
schweig
damit
dich

warnt
and
a
proper
storm
was
cooked
up
in
that
celebrated
finale
to
the
second
act
electronic
sound
effects
proved
slightly
alienating
but
what
does
one
do
in
a
concert
performance
if
not
exactly
folksy
and
does
one
really
want
that
there
was
certainly
a
nice

jauntiness

probably
credit

thirteen

it

discoloured

i
was

happy

it
looked

i
cleaned

up
i
would
recommend
this

to
anyone
with
interest
in
gardening
in
general
or
roses
in
particular
you
see
with
that
call
i
knew
she
was
gone
i
knew
that
that
part
of
my
heart
was
going
to
have
to
break
and
that
i
would
have
to
be
an
adult
and
accept
the
fact
that
she
had
gone

sixtieth
birthday
more
than
twenty
years
ago
he
was
very
pleased
to
be
able
to
shade
the
marquetry
using
hot
sand
heated
in
a
metal
tray
to
singe
the
individual
pieces
i
place
it
against
my
shoulder
and
smile
to
myself
i
look
in
the
mirror
and
see
the
silver
touch
my
pale
skin
this
time
there
is
no
hesitation
this
time
i
push
it
in
and
draw
it
down
ever
so
slowly
wincing
as
i
form
a
thin
red
line
to
go
with
the
three
pink
scars
already
there
i
smile
to
myself
as
the
pain
which
is
becoming
increasingly
familiar
takes
over
my
thoughts
for
a
few
moments
i
know
that
i
will
forget
about
being
bingirl
princess
pizza
face
or
any
of
the
other
names
people
call
me
the
pain
will
be
all
i
can
focus
on
and
i
will
be
happier
than
i
have
been
all
day
a
wedding
ring
that
won
t
be
worn
now
the
entire
album
does
not
feature
the
heavier
70s
groove
like
l'unica
chance
the
remaining
tracks
better
reflect
the
cheesecake
cover
image
in
that
the
vibe
is
more
laid
back
smoky
and
romantic
i
hope
you
agree
that
the
vocal
treatment
on
mistero
is
pretty
awesome
a
few
recovered
shows
and
fragments
have
come
from
guys
 
n
 
dolls
members
but
apparently
not
on
this
occasion
maybe
they
preferred
the
scaffolding
staging
of
supersonic
kelsey
borg
a
sophomore
from
maple
park
is
in
the
beginning
american
sign
language
class
and
described
her
first
silent
dinner
as
a
bit
nerve
racking
signing
felt
different
in
public
and
she
became
lost
when
more
advanced
students
had
intricate
conversations
she
said
if
you
have
not
seen
it
then
go
watch
it
you
will
not
regret
it
rules
straight
from
alex's
post
all
in
all
it
was
nice
for
a
sunday
afternoon
enjoyed
2lbs
of
delicious
crawfish
some
sausage
that
wasn
t
so
hot
potatoes
and
corn
they
put
a
big
ol
hunk
of
garlic
and
some
mushrooms
that
i
had
to
move
out
of
the
way
on
the
plate
too
i
don
t
know
about
you
all
who
have
enjoyed
this
louisiana
delicacy
but
i
ve
never
had
it
with
mushrooms
before
it
wasn
t
like
back
home
but
it
should
hold
me
over
til
my
next
visit
ok
i
am
back
on
again
these
last
two
weeks
have
been
really
rough
for
me
i
needed
a
little
time
away
from
this
i
suspect
it
comes
with
my
age
i
have
been
dealing
with
death
for
the
last
few
weeks
a
distant
reltive
who
was
also
a
close
friend
of
mine
died
three
weeks
ago
two
weeks
ago
my
aunt
died
her
death
was
followed
the
following
week
last
week
by
the
death
of
an
extremely
dear
childhood
friend
her
passing
truly
devastated
me
all
of
them
were
hard
to
deal
with
but
the
last
one
my
childhood
friend
was
the
hardest
she
was
very
very
close
to
me
for
my
formative
years
and
a
time
in
my
young
life
that
was
very
difficult
the
physics
are
floaty
reminiscent
of
littlebigplanet
you
and
objects
tend
to
stay
in
the
air
for
a
few
moments
objects
and
platforms
have
weight
and
will
tip
over
an
edge
the
physics
are
the
basis
of
some
puzzles
down
with
a
world
in
which
the
guarantee
that
will
not
die
of
starvation
has
been
purchased
with
the
guarantee
that
we
will
die
of
boredom
a
change
is
due
however
we
need
to
move
onwards
and
upwards
for
we
are
becoming
infatuated
with
the
sensations
the
physical
gives
us
and
are
loosing
our
own
base
frequency
as
a
result
the
effort
to
increase
our
frequencies
back
to
our
norm
is
gaining
pace
earth
the
centre
of
physical
excellence
the
only
physical
planet
to
have
inhabitants
of
free
will
to
work
with
it
is
the
focal
point
for
this
change
it
may
be
hard
to
believe
but
this
one
small
physical
entity
along
with
us
is
pivotal
in
the
effort
to
lift
the
universe
from
the
physical
frequencies
that
is
why
there
is
more
and
more
of
us
becoming
aware
of
our
true
role
in
the
universe
to
experience
and
evolve
cut
a
check
and
shut
up
they
said
less
time
but
still
too
much
with
the
boring
politician
is
he
still
in
the
race
a
week
after
being
shot
and
paralysed
i
guess
he
is
also
rosie
s
boyfriend
led
to
some
weird
connections
for
his
dad
he
seems
connected
in
some
way
but
not
sure
how
he
had
his
son
return
to
the
police
to
say
he
had
faked
the
text
but
it
wasn
t
clear
enough
whether
he
actually
had
or
not
or
his
father
forced
him
to
say
he
had
he
also
seems
to
have
had
a
relationship
with
rosie
s
aunt
hmm
3
what
materials
and
tools
do
you
use
so
hand
me
that
remote
and
according
to
him
that
first
step
was
even
before
he
physically
took
the
first
step
it
was
something
we
might
overlook
it
doesn
t
seem
like
much
it
was
just
a
small
thing
he
said
the
most
important
step
was
setting
a
date
and
telling
people
if
our
message
is
that
the
gospel
is
a
post
death
reality
then
it
is
no
wonder
people
are
not
interested
in
following
jesus
it
is
for
dead
people
dallas
willard
eloquently
said
once
that
the
gospel
is
not
about
getting
people
to
heaven
after
they
die
it
is
about
getting
them
there
before
they
do
i
think
he
is
right
is
it
awesome
is
it
terrible
therefore
do
not
be
anxious
about
tomorrow
for
tomorrow
will
be
anxious
for
itself
sufficient
for
the
day
is
its
own
trouble

my
skin
has
never
looked
better
and
i
cant
believe
how
fast
i
have
gone
from
spotty
to
glowy
with
just
two
products
if
you
missed
my
skincare
post
its
here
i
left
in
a
plume
of
ridicule
in
many
ways
i
see
writing
voice
to
be
very
similar
to
artistic
style
if
you
hang
around
art
sites
like
deviantart
long
enough
no
doubt
you
will
run
into
half
a
dozen
artists
in
a
day
claiming
the
critique
is
wrong
because
oversized
hands
or
noses
or
whatever
are
part
of
their
style
when
in
reality
they
just
don
t
want
to
admit
they
need
to
practice
more
i
ve
used
the
same
excuse
to
explain
why
i
didn
t
need
to
take
a
human
anatomy
class
to
fix
my
anime
inspired
art
back
in
high
school
it
s
often
a
sign
of
insecurity
and
inexperience
or
it
s
a
sign
of
stagnation
and
comfort
first
of
which
ought
to
probably
get
fixed
fast
the
second
of
which
is
okay
but
in
moderation
personally
i
dress
sporty
and
casual
and
i
think
it
complements
my
comedy
style
nicely
bitter
child
has
little
to
do
with
experiences
from
my
life
and
more
to
do
with
the
tragedy
in
the
lives
of
many
people
especially
women
who
are
in
a
relationship
that
leads
to
the
birth
of
a
child
specifically
this
poem
is
about
the
birth
of
an
unwanted
child
and
the
helplessness
and
bitterness
that
define
the
flavor
of
the
woman
s
heart
and
symbolically
her
milk
peter
loves
to
cook
and
eat
too
so
they
named
each
table
after
the
famous
chefs
we
happened
to
be
sitting
at
the
giada
de
laurentiis
 
table
where
giada
is
one
of
my
favorites
and
for
each
place
setting
they
gave
each
of
us
a
little
grater
it
was
really
cute
do
i
have
criticisms
of
myself
um
no
doy
i
always
will
i
ve
written
since
i
was
4
years
old
it
was
clearly
a
way
for
me
to
express
the
supressed
trauma
when
my
kids
started
to
leave
home
i
decided
to
see
if
i
could
get
published
i
ve
always
known
i
could
do
it
but
had
never
really
found
my
voice
i
joined
a
local
writing
class
and
it
became
apparent
from
week
number
one
that
i
really
could
write
each
week
i
got
great
feedback
which
inspired
me
to
write
love
hearts
and
suddenly
i
d
found
my
voice
and
had
an
agent
and
a
publisher
it
all
happened
quite
quickly
the
only
other
study
i
ve
done
is
to
read
lots
of
kids
books
and
to
read
a
book
on
plotting
probably
why
i
am
a
little
stressed
what
have
you
bought
online
recently
i
will
be
back
soon
and
a
big
hello
to
new
followers
so
first
i
scrubbed
everything
down
with
tsp
let
them
bake
in
yesterday's
hot
sun
then
got
to
work
last
night
keep
up
the
good
work
or
lack
thereof
as
we
have
seen
the
foods
sovereignty
movement
of
la
via
campesina
has
recently
spread
across
the
states
the
emergence
of
this
peasant
movement
in
the
first
world
is
do
to
the
global
economic
depression
and
the
down
on
small
local
farmers
in
the
name
of
food
security
4
it
is
a
sunshine
day
the
brady
bunch
one
of
the
items
that
i
included
in
the
kits
was
a
piece
of
corrugated
cardstock
i
gave
all
the
design
team
a
challenge
to
make
an
embellishment
out
of
it
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
seeing
what
everyone
came
up
with
and
they
did
not
disappoint
after
playing
around
with
my
corrugated
piece
this
is
what
i
ended
up
with
because
it
ruined
your
day
sort
of
conversation
you
do
not
yet
understand
sudan
which
was
africa
s
largest
country
before
the
south
gained
independence
in
july
sits
atop
some
of
the
continent
s
most
significant
oil
resources
or
go
visit
her
store
in
fort
greene
brooklyn
it
is
down
the
street
from
spike
lee's
forty
acres
and
a
mule
production
company
front
cool
if
i
recall
correctly
he
explained
that
i
was
insulin
resistant
had
high
testosterone
and
was
considered
pre
diabetic
now
i
had
to
go
on
a
lean
meat
and
vegetable
diet
or
i
would
get
diabetes
5
visit
the
caves
in
lascaux
france
the
caves
are
famous
for
their
paleolithic
cave
paintings
my
ceramics
professor
visited
those
caves
in
the
early
90
s
after
he
returned
he
was
a
changed
man
he
even
had
his
license
plate
personalized
with
the
word
lascaux
i
admired
my
ceramics
professor
so
much
i
think
if
i
visited
the
lascaux
caves
i
would
have
a
life
altering
experience
as
well
doesn
t
everyone
desire
something
monumental
in
their
life
well
the
full
load
of
stories
will
stay
up
until
my
birthday
may
31st
buy
your
cards
now
and
then
i
shall
take
most
of
them
down
i
shall
be
leaving
up
those
which
have
been
published
elsewhere
with
links
to
those
publications
which
have
had
the
wonderful
taste
to
feature
my
work
he
came
to
see
me
after
my
shift
like
10
00
that
night
and
he
holds
my
hand
only
happened
once
before
and
that
was
cuz
he
kept
tickling
me
and
i
asked
if
i
had
to
hold
his
hand
to
get
him
to
stop
he
said
yes
smooth
hubs
real
smooth
after
a
few
minutes
of
talking
about
who
the
knows
because
all
i
can
think
about
is
him
holding
my
hand
he
asks
so
does
this
mean
yes
sixth
a
trainee
is
basically
a
glorified
assistant
your
responsibilities
seem
only
to
be
helping
out
with
the
setting
up
and
breaking
of
camp
helping
preparation
of
breakfast
lunch
and
dinner
and
cleaning
and
mingling
with
guests
on
the
drives
not
hugely
laborious
admittedly
but
i
thought
the
idea
of
a
trainee
was
that
they
were
trained
on
how
to
do
the
job
rather
than
teach
us
any
of
the
accounts
or
how
to
get
groups
through
immigration
or
organise
local
safaris
we
were
just
used
to
make
the
boring
jobs
easier
when
you
are
in
the
forest
you
become
a
seamless
part
of
it
when
you
are
in
the
rain
you
are
a
part
of
the
rain
when
you
are
in
the
morning
you
are
a
seamless
part
of
the
morning
when
you
are
with
me
you
become
a
part
of
me
into
the
animal
barn
here
at
the
farm
house
it
is
been
a
while
since
december
in
fact
since
i
pulled
out
the
brew
equipment
well
with
the
return
of
summer
and
my
recently
purchased
though
not
yet
assembled
mlt
the
time
has
come
to
make
some
beer
now
the
little
brew
devil
inside
of
me
is
pulling
me
in
a
few
different
ways
and
i
have
a
couple
of
obligations
to
previously
conjured
brews
so
the
brew
schedule
is
filling
up
fast
here's
a
quick
run
down
tender
mercies
and
your
compassion
that
never
fails
i
prayed
for
many
as
i
thought
about
this
day
and
its
impact
on
the
heart
but
jewry
has
now
met
its
match
its
nemesis
vladimir
putin
is
warning
the
jewish
led
by
the
nose
us
and
nato
that
they
will
not
be
allowed
to
repeat
their
feat
in
libya

overthrowing

ousting

customers
needs

to
be
relatively
stable
over
time
while
the
offerings
improve
at
a
much
faster
rate
anyway
we
had
awesome
seats
and
an
awesome
time
and
what
was
even
more
awesome
was
when
at
the
end
of
his
show
and
before
his
encore
performance
david
announced
for
the
first
time
that
he
will
be
serving
a
full
time
mission
for
our
church
the
church
of
jesus
christ
of
latter

saints
it
was
such
a
special
moment
and
everyone
stood
up
and
cheered
bringing
him
to
tears
it
was

this
week
i
have
felt
more
energetic
more
hopeful
and
more
eager
to
get
on
with
things
than
i
remember
having
felt
in
a
decade
probably
fulfilling
the
dream
of
almost
full
time
classes
has
a
lot
to
do
with
it
it
was
a
big
part
of
what
kept
me
going
through
all
that
last
year
actually
the
history
of
worship
on
the
site
goes
back
even
further
in
march
1736
charles
wesley
held
worship
services
for
the
new
settlers
at
frederica
in
1737
john
wesley
established
a
church
for
the
people
of
frederica
and
the
other
settlement
on
the
island
fort
st
simon
when
john
wesley
left
st
simons
he
was
replaced
by
george
whitefield
all
three
men
held
services
on
the
site
of
the
present
church
so
the
clown
stalked
her
discreetly
for
the
next
few
days
and
eventually
caught
her
off
guard
when
she
was
bending
over
to
pick
up
her
lucky
alligator
s
tooth
he
promptly
buried
his
nose
between
her
cheeks
causing
her
to
squawk
like
a
parrot
and
belly
dive
onto
the
ground
honour
was
satisfied
and
they
became
the
best
of
friends
second
one
if
i
wasn
t
conditioned
i
couldn
t
be
controlled
i
would
ask
a
lot
of
uncomfortable
questions
questioning
authority
the
very
way
i
live
and
the
world
i
live
in
i
wouldn
t
buy
things
that
are
in
the
ads
i
wouldn
t
occupy
my
mind
chasing
money
or
fame
or
women
i
wouldn
t
be
a
to
meaningless
impulses
i
wouldn
t
be
a
sheep
that
everyone
wants
to
people
don
t
want
rebels
they
re
uncomfortable
to
live
with
surrounded
by
traditional
music
when
she
was
a
kid
when
i
when
observing
human
behavior
gets
too
much
for
my
nerves
during
unpreoccupied
moments
i
sometimes
fantasize
i
could
just
escape
in
between
the
pages
of
a
piece
of
literature
this
usually
happens
when
i
m
stuck
in
traffic
inside
a
public
transport
waiting
in
long
lines
in
the
grocery
or
restaurants
or
for
certain
people
or
any
situation
for
that
matter
that
requires
me
to
wait
for
forever
and
a
half
although
i
always
have
in
my
bag
the
book
that
i
m
currently
reading
most
of
the
time
i
wish
i
m
reading
instead
that
certain
novel
which
i
ve
been
wanting
to
get
my
teeth
into
but
don
t
have
the
book
yet
that
s
why
i
came
up
with
the
idea
of
bluetoothing
the
e
books
i
ve
downloaded
from
the
internet
which
i
seem
to
have
lost
interest
in
reading
because
reading
literature
on
a
laptop
is
just
so
unappealingly
sad
and
cumbersome
to
the
android
phone
so
that
when
the
need
for
me
to
read
them
comes
up
again
i
could
just
barely
touch
the
android
screen
and
voila
i
have
escaped
as
a
country
that
is
trying
to
modernize
its
economy
and
society
this
fundamentalist
mindset
poses
a
unique
challenge
since
the
late
1970s
this
faction
of
society
has
had
immense
decision
making
power
particularly
in
education
and
the
courts
the
two
areas
where
interaction
between
the
government
and
the
average
citizen
is
greatest
three
decades
later
they
have
managed
to
make
their
ideology
the
foundation
on
which
education
and
justice
are
based
even
appointing
progressive
ministers
has
failed
to
make
any
substantial
change
because
from
the
bottom
up
the
system
is
sustained
by
people
who
have
a
religious
conviction
to
resist
change
nothing
is
harder
to
shake
than
that
type
of
conviction
calabama

up

and
i
will
be
back
soon
to
share
more
with
you
there
is
still
a
critical
need
for
skilled
workers
across
a
range
of
australian
industries
the
skills

expo
in
london
will
target
the
industries
most
in
need
of
skilled
workers
such
as
the
mining
health
and
construction
industries
apparently
emerie
was
worn
out
from
all
that
singing
excitement
one
who
focused
mainly
on
judaism
and
who
as
far
as
is
known
wrote
the
first
polemic
work
directed
against
the
jews
alone
is
the
jewish
convert
samaw
el
al
maghrabi
also
spelled
samau
al
he
was
born
in
baghdad
in
1126
though
some
traditions
puts
his
year
of
birth
in
1130
i
have
chosen
to
follow
moshe
perlmann
here
the
son
of
a
jewish
rabbi
who
moved
there
from
northern
africa
he
was
taught
in
mathematics
and
is
mostly
known
for
his
works
on
that
subject
especially
his
al
bahir
fi
l
jabr
but
after
his
conversion
in
1163
he
began
to
write
his
polemic
work
against
the
jews
ifham
al
yah
d
silencing
the
jew
that
book
was
rewritten
in
a
new
version
four
years
after
with
some
additions
if
we
walk
in
the
light
and
the
glory
of
is
lived
in
our
lives
then
why
do
we
box
ourselves
into
a
conformity
that
i
cite
all
this
history
because
the
history
of
america
along
with
a
careful
analysis
of
its
demographics
its
population
native
born
and
naturalized
portends
that
once
we
get
past
the
megolomania
and
marxist
ideology
of
the
current
pretender
to
the
throne
oops
i
mean
to
the
oval
office
america
is
ideally
poised
to
dig
itself
out
of
its
current
financial
difficulties
compliment
the
author
white
told
the
story
of
his
work
and
imprisonment
in
the

he
also
wrote

numerous
articles

in

which
is
distributed
to
more
than
500

i
should

because
my
experience
as

has
already
provided
me
with

and
the

i
m
scared
voluntary
work
will
suffer
greatly
when
the
introduction
of
all
the
activities
mentioned
above
takes
place
vital
local
and
mostly
charitable
services
such
as
support
for
the
disabled
local
youth
football
teams
or
even
just
a
friendly
ear
and
a
hot
cup
of
coffee
may
have
to
face
the
stigma
of
having
perverse
single
parents
volunteering
with
them
or
feckless
benefit
bums
working
with
them
all
because
of
the
stigma
attached
to
the
wp
services
may
have
to
be
reduced
and
costs
cut
back
even
more
as
people
may
start
thinking
well
they
ll
get
the
people
on
the
dole
to
do
it
i
don
t
need
to
there
are
many
ways
to
use
umbrellas
for
singing
time
here
are
a
few
ways
that
we
have
thought
of
if
i
could
do
that
that
is
what
i'd
do
for
my
sweet
friend
korin
whose
birthday
is
tomorrow
when
i
call
to
you
in
prayer

we
re
the
internet
dispute
organization
authorized
by
the
government
which
mainly
deal
with
international
company's
in
asia
we
have
something
important
need
to
confirm
with
your
company
do
you
ever
think
off
what
to
do
with
the
extra
tomato
and
chillies
sauce
in
packet
after
having
your
kfc
yes
here
goes
into
the
sweet
and
sour
sauce
great
idea
from
my
in
law
well
it
is
alright
to
use
the
tomato
sauce
from
bottle
i
omit
the
chili
sauce
as
my
kids
can
not
take
heat
but
we
made
it
home
alright
said
horatio
and
what
a
welcome
it
was
when
we
entered
this
kitchen
remember
you
my
dear
d
together
with
mr
c
waiting
for
us
it
was
in
a
bleak
midwinter
night
that
we
arrived
home
on
your
doorstep
very
hungry
this
is
not
subtle
but
explaining
it
is
difficult
because
it
is
almost
impossible
to
see
if
one
is
not
attuned
to
this
kind
of
propaganda
but
to
an
englishman
who
has
been
made
to
feel
guilty
from
birth
for
our
history
it
was
plain
a
jewish
friend
in
america
emailed
me
in
some
distress
and
to
be
sure
she
had
got
it
right
i
asked
what
situations
the
jewish
character
is
shown
in
as
soon
as
she
said
exploiting
blacks
i
knew
she
had
spotted
something
important
because
that
is
how
we
english
are
made
to
feel
guilty
by
negative
stereotypes
which
destroy
the
humanity
of
a
select
group
and
dehumanises
them
once
that
takes
hold
anything
can
be
done
to
them
because
they
cease
to
be
seen
as
human
once
this
is
explained
it
is
plain

i
also

is

great
fast
low
priced

the

shows
how
there
is
a
little
bit
of
distressing
done
where
the
stripes
don
t
cross
over
for
a
great
realistic
look
i'd
love
to
be
able
to
move
somewhere
warm
their
jobs
were
morally
complex

this
is
not
weird
but
i
would
give
anything
i
have
for
those
i
love
even
if
i
never
see
them
again
fear
noun
one
way
or
another
though
what
you
contemplate
you
imitate
choose
your
contemplations
well
people
live
or
die
and
thousands
of
lives
are
indelibly
altered
based
on
decisions
about
where
to
drive
today
when
to
have
who
to
discuss
these
things
with
and
whether
to
buy
that
pair
of
bcbg
shoes
it
is
always
those
tiniest
of
choices
that
hindsight
allows
you
to
see
as
pivotal
moments
altered
histories
are
all
around
us
embedded
in
our
lives
to
such
an
extent
that
it
becomes
difficult
to
imagine
for
we
indeed
have
to
imagine
what
reality
is
what
the
truth
or
the
real
news
of
human
action
actually
looks
like
this
is
most
apparent
in
the
world
of
words
where
the
writer
takes
life
in
and
presents
it
the
best
they
can
but
always
through
the
filter
of
their
own
humanity
but
as
so
many
theorists
have
been
quick
to
point
out
over
and
over
again
it
is
the
domain
of
the
modified
image
that
contains
the
most
power
to
alter
history
and
compel
a
certain
beliefs
about
its
factual

says
ceo
ed
johnson
one
of
the
criticisms
that
people
have
given
the
voice
is
that
nearly
every
contestant
had
a
sob
story
personally
i
don
t
think
that
this
was
a
bad
thing
they
were
not
used
as
bargaining
tools
i
e
please
put
me
through
because
i
was
bullied
at
school
but
as
a
reason
why
they
could
not
audition
for
any
other
show
this
makes
them
stand
out
and
really
makes
you
feel
for
them
and
you
feel
even
better
when
they
get
through
or
even
worse
when
they
don
t
i
certainly
do
not
wish
to
see
tda
become
any
larger
than
what
it
is
right
now
fortunately
i
had
trip
cancellation
insurance
so
i
can
take
the
money
and
buy
another
tour
sometime
in
the
yet
to
be
determined
future
in
the
meantime
i
will
put
the
china
novel
on
the
back
burner
and
get
to
work
on
the
other
novel
i
am
writing
the
first
chapter
will
be
a
bear
but
after
that
it
will
be
a
hoot
makes
you
think
all
the
world's
a
sunny
day
oh
yeah
vanilla
ice
cream
coated
in
caramelised
white
chocolate
and
macadamia
nuts
i
looked
around
and
searching
for
new
inspiration
3
the
new
bill
is
to
be
modelled
on
a
system
currently
in
place
in
the
us
state
of
oregon
where
the
annual
number
of
assisted
suicides
has
increased
dramatically
by
over
450
since
being
legalised
in
1997
where
one
in
six
of
those
dying
are
depressed
less
than
one
in
20
receive
psychiatric
assessments
and
some
patients
have
actually
been
denied
medical
care
and
offered
assisted
suicide
as
a
cheaper
alternative
but
then
we
do
a
complete
180
and
look
at
the
other
perspective
i
look
at
all
the
amazing
things
that
have
happened
or
will
happen
i
ve
been
given
a
chance
to
start
my
life
over
again
i
ve
been
given
a
chance
to
escape
this
wouldn
t
have
happened
if
certain
key
events
had
taken
place
i
look
at
some
of
my
friends
lives
and
you
can
t
just
help
but
notice
that
some
amazing
things
have
happened
and
they
acknowledge
it
they
don
t
take
credit
for
it
not
one
bit
it
didnt
have
to
be
emotional
the
theme
was
most
memorable
year
but
of
course
it
was
emotional
because
obviously
the
best
sotry
wins
the
night
am
i
right
you
know
i
am
i
decided
to
go
without
my
ipod
this
morning
and
just
enjoy
the
peace
and
quiet
of
a
nice
sunny
morning
no
traffic
no
noises
just
peaceful
i
let
my
mind
wander
to
what
the
rest
of
the
day
was
going
to
bring
i
baked
a
dessert
last
night
to
take
to
my
dad's
house
for
dinner
with
the
family
i
was
going
to
come
home
to
a
nice
breakfast
my
dear
hubs
cooked
for
me
and
hopefully
the
kiddos
would
behave
themselves
some
what
today
the
point
of
the
query
is
to
win
an
agent
s
attention
and
get
a
request
for
sample
pages
now
your
sample
pages
have
to
hold
up
the
greatest
query
letter
in
the
world
is
not
going
to
compensate
for
unready
sample
pages
let
s
pause
for
a
moment
and
do
some
quick
math
i
look
forward
to
many
days
of
blogging
with
you
kleinfeld
s
new
men
s
department
has
a
great
guide
to
the
different
formal
wear
and
suiting
style
for
men
you
can
see
it
along
with
their
product
selection
at

what
i
really
liked
about
hyundai
s
iphone
game
is
that
the
users
leave
with
the
hyundai
app
on
their
phone
which
can
be
used
to
push
content
at
a
later
stage
and
connect
with
the
players
after
the
game
after
that
comply
with
the
task
in
order
to
evaluate
improvement
send
memory
joggers
if
you
want
to
review
work
along
the
way
if
that
s
appropriate
other
things
but
the
plot
unfolds
to
show
that
kowalski's
neighbours
are
as
racist
as
he
is
and
in
fact
he
not
only
redeems
his
own
character
but
becomes
a
heroic
figure
in
his
neighbourhood
by
taking
on
the
gangs
and
at
the
same
time
taking
thao
his
neighbour's
son
under
his
wing
how
 
racist
 
is
he
really
kowalski's
most
vicious
scorn
is
reserved
for
the
white
boy
who
wears
his
cap
backwards
and
tries
to
talk
 
black
 
to
the
black
kids
kowalski
rightly
calls
him
a
p
ssy
for
failing
to
stick
up
for
his
girlfriend
remember
me
remember
i
told
you
that
it
would
be
all
this
and
more

the
exception
which
is
not
codified
in
the
existing
legal
order
can
at
best
be
characterized
as
a
case
of
extreme
peril
a
danger
to
the
existence
of
the
state
or
the
like
but
it
cannot
be
circumscribed
factually
and
made
to
conform
to
a
preformed
law
blogger
have
finally
got
an
app
for

dickens
that
rag
and
bone
man
didn
t
invent
the
prunish
woman
the
old
maid
was
a
figure
of
fun
long
before
he
steamed
into
print
and
if
we
unflinchingly
follow
the
history
of
the
prune
it
turns
out
that
it
was
once
associated
with
the
oldest
of
maids
behind
the
prune
wielding
disciplined
ranks
of
the
governess
the
nurse
and
the
headmistress
lounges
the
most
venerable
professional
woman
of
them
all
the
we
still
sometimes
call
a
brothel
a
stew
and
it
is
because
of
the
innocuous
stewed
prune
a
1612
collection
of
satirical
poems
called
the
knave
of
hearts
features
a
knave
who
takes
burnt
wine
stew
d
prunes
a
punk
to
solace
him
and
in
a
similar
collection
published
a
year
earlier
the
knave
of
spades
a
wanton
entices
a
young
man
into
her
house
of
vice
by
a
global
good
news
staff
writer
the
meeting
is
not
productive
for
them
but
one
doctor
stays
behind
he
knows
who
frankenstein
really
is
and
blackmails
to
become
his
assistant
frankenstein
shows
him
the
experients
he
is
working
on
most
involve
severed
limbs
of
course
the
masterpiece
plan
is
to
place
the
brai
of
a
brilliant
but
crippled
colleague
into
a
new
body
i
am
writing
this
letter
as
a
person
that
has
known
cathy
for
nearly
nine
years
please
give
her
a
second
chance
as
a
friend
i
know
that
when
you
met
her
you
thought
she
was
a
hard
right
republican
and
that
she
doesn
t
know
how
to
have
a
good
time
you
probably
figured
she
has
a
blog
about
cleaning
tips
she
is
none
of
those
things
now
on
to
my
card
for
today
i
was
not
sure
of
how
this
card
was
coming
along
at
first
and
then
once
i
just
kept
adding
things
here
and
there
the
finished
product
kind
of
makes
me
swoon
a
little
it
is
not
a
typical
card
from
me
but
i
like
that
definitely
gotta
keep
some
spice
in
life
when
it
comes
to
card
making
here
is
what
i
created
the
mad
human
virus
i
think
that
is
why
i
like
darby

griffin
series
so
much
her
newest
one
comes
out
this
month
plus
get
a
chance
to
win

rising
check
at
the
end
to
find
out
how
her
angels
are
angels
they
have
powers
and
can
fly
but
they
definitely
have
a
very
human
side
to
them
and
they
have
a
tendency
to
just
walk
into
peoples
lives
when
they
need
it
the
most
and
then
walk
away
not
asking
for
any
sort
of
compensation
or
even
acknowledgement

i
don

the
article
uses
humour
to
demonstrate
issues
it
was
used
to
provoke
emotion
and
then
debate
in
that
regard
it
served
its
purpose
now
all
i
need
to
do
is
work
on
the
plot
any
ideas

hugs
they
reached
the
end
of
the
shatterbury
platform
and
ran
up
it
and
along
to
the
ticket
area
at
this
time
of
night
there
was
no
one
else
on
the
platform
and
the
blinds
were
drawn
down
over
the
two
teller
windows
in
the
cold
echoing
ticket
hall
the
station
was
deserted
and
all
ben
could
hear
was
the
rhythmic
ticking
of
the
digital
clock
that
hung
above
platform
one
counting
down
the
minutes
to
the
next
train
well
it
was
a
natural
progression
for
a
dr
who
fan
such
as
myself
to
move
to
the
next
best
thing
from
the
program
i
loved
the
book
happy
friday
the
13th
y'all
if
there
was
anytime
to
talk
about
the
friday
the
13th
series
it
is
now
it
is
an
interesting
movie
because
even
if
you
have
not
seen
the
original
you
are
probably
not
far
off
in
guessing
what
goes
on
in
in
earlier
on
in
my
horror
movie
watching
career
i
watched
the
entire
series
when
i
was
11
or
12
and
holy
are
they
boring
they
just
get
more
and
more
nonsensical
and
frankly
i
like
a
little
bat
crazy
with
my
nonsensical
see
nightmare
on
elm
street
series
but
there
was
one
moment
of
the
whole
friday
series
that
scared
the
bejesus
out
of
me
these
police
officers
have
no
clue
because
nobody
told
them
that
if
the
person
they
swear
an
oath
to
is
in
error
so
are
they
if
the
monarch
is
rendered
powerless
so
are
they
and
every
single
government
agent
if
i
were
a
copper
and
i
discovered
that
my
ultimate
boss
had
no
authority
i
would
have
no
option
but
to
resign
and
i
would
do
so
the
moment
i
knew
it
to
be
so
enjoy
and
have
a
fantastic
weekend
first
i
was
trying
to
prove
that
i
can
slowly
find
readers
who
aren
t
my
friends
ted
came
to
see
us
late
last
year
and
we
brewed
a
beer
this
is
where
i
m
the
opposite
of
obama
i
believe
we
need
to
have
somebody
who
fights
for
hardworking
taxpayers
the
commercial
appeal
posts
many
strange
stories
like
the
article
about
bush
senior
parachuting
out
of
an
airplane
on
his
eightieth
birthday
next
to
the
article
was
a
photo
similar
to
the
one
above
with
the
headline
the
aftermath
apparently
that
was
not
stranger
than
other
photos
because
jay
leno
never
used
it
for
headline
news
so
in
order
to
find
something
stranger
i
searched
the
internet
for
bizarre
news
stories
are
they
any
stranger
than
what
i
found
in
the
commercial
appeal
she
managed
to
hold
it
together
pretty
well
on
camera
telling
the
judges
this
year
looks
not
much
at
all
about
presents
it
has
a
really
long
drying
finish
as
well
while
i
thought
about
sweet
pancakes
i
did
not
think
this
imperial
stout
would
work
too
well
with
them
sh
it
does
not
really
go
with
the
new
shirts
you
got
me
ec
deputy

wan
ahmad
wan
omar
said
the
errors
could
be
due
to
the
negligence
of
military
officers
who
have
been
appointed
aros
for
my
last
card
i
used
the
wonderful
let

snow
set
which
i
have
had
my
eye
on
for
a
long
time
anyone
who
knows
me
knows
that
i
love
snowmen
this
is
an
amazing
set
with
tremendous
versatility
and
did
i
mention

the
class
of

and
the

team
honored
chris
throughout
the
2006
2007
school
year
the
bulldogs
wore
chris
50
on
our
helmets
and
chris
was
buried
wearing
his
black
home
jersey
his
mother
cheryl
wore
his
white
50
throughout
the
entire
season
the
first
time
i
received
the
sunshine
award
i
nominated
the
required
suggested
5
people
and
somehow
it
does
not
seem
right
to
nominate
another
5
but
a
couple
of
the
people
i
gave
the
award
to
the
last
time
did
not
play
no
criticism
implied
and
kc
has
asked
for
a

she
already
has
the

award
but
not
the
sunshine
award
miss
daisy
is
in
hospice
care
now
he
returned
home
happy
with
a
light
tan
and
thankfully
keen
to
tell
us
all
about
the
trip
his
case
had
been
neatly
packed
there
were
no
hideous
surprises
and
as
it
was
mother's
day
he
handed
me
a
bar
of
soap
he'd
bought
at
a
local
soap
factory
 
yeah
 
he
said
 
our
teacher
gave
us
the
nudge
that
we
should
all
probably
buy
our
mums
something
from
the
factory
shop
so
here
you
are
 
lavender
not
my
favourite
scent
if
i
am
honest
but
hey
it
is
the
thought
that
counts
or
at
least
the
thought
of
his
french
teacher
merci
beaucoup
monsieur
who
are
those
hooded
hordes
swarming
vanity
you
want
the
prestige
whatever
it
may
be
of
signing
with
a
legacy
house
although
a
lot
has
happened
during
the
past
20
years
one
fact
stands
head
and
shoulders
above
the
rest
and
that
is
this
world
has
changed
it
is
no
longer
the
same
place
it
was
20
years
ago
and
20
years
is
really
not
that
long
if
you
come
to
think
of
it
it
is
most
definitely
not
the
same
place
as
it
was
more
than
2000
years
ago
when
jesus
and
his
disciples
were
still
around
it
is
all
about
playing
live
of
course
we
try
to
make
our
albums
as
great
as
we
can
but
this
kind
of
music
is
so
much
about
live
performance
we
love
to
play
live

memo
to
the
secret
team
if
you
do
not
release

you
will
die
with
us
we
were
mostly
college
age
folks
clean
cut
and
with
cheerful
dispositions
tip
your
face
downwards
while
looking
in
the
mirror
to
see
where
the
shadows
fall
under
the
cheekbones
if
your
cheekbones
are
not
prominent
feel
along
your
face
and
apply
bronzer
in
a
medium
shade
in
a
line
just
under
it
to
form
the

rimmel

the
skunks
were
four
guys
pulled
together
by
guitarist
larry
lynne
aka
larry
ostricki
of
the
western
milwaukee
suburb
of
waukesha
he
brought
in
rick

to
play

duane

playing
on
the
band's
name
larry
had
everyone
dye
their
hair
black
with
a
white
stripe
down
the
side
the
band
first
appeared
in
1964
at
a
place
called
monreal's
on
16th
street
at
national
avenue
the
group
went
to
chicago
to
record
some
demos
with
the
legendary
sonny
boy
williamson
sitting
in
on
harmonica
but
those
recordings
were
never
released
a
couple
of
changes
were
made
with
rick

replaced
by
jack

peplinski
on
drums
the
band
moved
about
100
blocks
west
to
a
place
called
papa
joe's
in
brookfield
tony
kolp
was
then
replaced
by
randy
klein
playing
rhythm
guitar
and
the
band
moved
out
to
california
they
played
at
a
club
called
gold
street
in
garden
grove
they
cut
their
first
record
on
the
era
label
for
release
in
november
1965
but
the
label's
owner
herb
newman
did
not
like
their
name
and
changed
it
to
the
unbelievables
for
that
release
for
their
second
single
the
guys
went
to
the
gold
star
studio
and
recorded
their
version
of
elvira
along
with
the
flip
side
the
journey
the
record
was
not
released
until
the
band
moved
back
to
milwaukee
makes
about
4
cups
or
1
litre
i
also
wanted
to
get
away
from
the
idea
of
high
tech
heists
executed
by
brilliant
thieves
the
kind
you
often
see
depicted
in
movies
and
books
let
s
face
it
if
someone
was
that
brilliant
they
d
be
doing
something
else
with
their
lives
the
commander
of
the
alamo
william
travis
quickly
assembled
his
men
he
told
them
that
no
reinforcements
were
coming
our
doom
is
certain
travis
told
the
tired
beaten
men
then
travis
pulled
his
sword
from
its
sheath
and
drew
a
line
in
the
dirt
he
asked
every
man
who
was
committed
to
remain
in
the
alamo
fight
and
die
to
cross
the
line
the
difference
is
that
last
spring
he
was
a
little
peanut
squirming
around
attached
at
the
nose
by
a
line
of
oxygen
today
he
is
still
pretty
squirmy
but
with
clearly
defined
motor
control
and
he
is
able
to
breath
his
own
air
he
is
about
to
hit
18
months
and
he
is
turned
into
a
pretty
healthy
extra
cute
kid
look
see
and
then
i
fall
instead
i
was
in
the
hospital
i
had
caved
under
stress
and
had
the
same
friend
who
took
me
for
my
mri
let
s
call
her
b
take
me
back
for
this
nervous
breakdown
i
was
checked
into
the
hospital
as
such
and
pushed
around
all
over
the
hallways
unlike
most
hospitals
however
this
one
was
filled
to
the
brim
with
cats
they
were
very
therapeutic
to
me
as
one
could
imagine
i
love
cats
many
people
reply
that
we
are
part
of
nature
and
part
of
the
planet
and
have
the
same
right
to
live
on
the
earth
as
other
animals
in
an
ideal
world
with
much
fewer
people
living
in
balance
with
nature
perhaps
that
would
be
the
case
but
we
do
not
help
preserve
any
natural
balance
we
do
not
provide
anything
that
other
plants
or
animals
in
a
natural
setting
need
for
survival
ultimately
the
animals
and
the
natural
environment
would
be
far
better
off
with
fewer
or
no
human
inhabitants
the
excitement
luis
had
felt
now
infused
pete
and
he
recognized
an
opportunity
with
prof
sinclair
gone
for
at
least
another
two
weeks
pete
would
have
time
to
examine
the
interior
on
his
own
if
he
moved
quickly
he
might
be
able
to
submit
the
initial
findings
under
his
own
name
rather
than
as
second
author
status
under
sinclair
this
find
pete
realized
could
mean
the
difference
between
getting
his
first
job
at
podunk
college
for
the
semi
literate
or
getting
his
first
job
at
ivy
covered
research
university
he
would
have
to
cut
corners
he
would
have
to
move
fast
and
he
would
have
to
document
his
findings
in
some
public
way
10

after
another

at

is
it
time
for
me
to
quit

i
never
thought
i'd
ask
myself
that
question
i
do
not
want
to
ask
myself
that
question
because
i
am
afraid
of
what
the
answer
might
be
but
i
have
to
ask
myself
that
question
and
i
have
to
find
an
answer
and
a
reason
to
keep
doing
what
i
love
in
the
place
where
i
used
to
love
doing
it
just
to
clarify
these
are
people
who
routinely
work
with
free
energy
anti

teleportation
stargate
travel
and
time

i
put
it
all
back
in
the

sealed
the

with

set
it

i
have

using
the

light
in
my

as
i
thought
it
would
be
good
as
we
put
the
baby's
bassinet
in
our
room
for
the
first
few
months
my
bedroom
has
always
felt
stuffy
to
me
especially
at
times
when
my
husband
seems
to
sweat
a
lot
in
bed
i
have
definitely
felt
the
room
seems
fresher
since
putting
the
healthy
night
light
in
it
the
night
light
is
a
perfect
level
of
light
as
it
is
not
too
bright
but
has
enough
to
give
the
room
some
light
i
originally
had
it
in
my
sons
room
but
decided
to
try
it
in
my
room
because
i
felt
my
room
needed
more
freshening
seeing
it
is
warmer
dustier
and
the
pets
go
in

more
i
am
thinking
i
need

i
m
wearing
a
pale
peachy
pink
colored
lipstick
on
my
lips
with
some
pink
gloss
over
it
i
have
been
mulling
over
this
post
for
a
long
time
now
and
one
thing
i
was
wondering
about
was
how
to
present
the
information
i
ve
gathered
over
the
last
few
months
i
eventually
decided
to
split
this
into
a
series
of
posts
with
this
being
the
first
part
it
has
certainly
helped
that
obari
joined
twitter
last
summer
as
many
of
his
tweets
have
shown
a
great
insight
into
his
career
and
many
of
the
shows
he
has
worked
on
i
am
the
99
it
is
a
welcoming
warming
and
rather
nice
place
full
of
hidden
nooks
bay
windowed
corners
and
walls
strewn
with
various
beer
ephemera
memorabilia
and
bric
a
brac
from
ale
times
gone
by
it
is
avery
homely
and
pleasant
environment
to
waste
away
a
drizzly
cumbrian
late
afternoon
and
evening
there
is
a
downside
to
the
cask
too
once
tapped
the
cask
will
not
fit
into
either
of
my
temperature
controlled
fridges
so
it
has
to
be
at
the
ambient
temperature
in
the
garage
with
temperatures
a
bit
below
the
norm
for
this
time
of
year
it
is
being
served
at
around
8c
which
is
definitely
a
tad
chilly
by
the
time
i
reach
the
end
of
the
pint
it
is
noticeable
that
the
flavour
has
improved
but
with
temperatures
likely
to
rise
over
the
next
couple
of
months
hopefully
this
will
not
be
a
problem
for
future

is
our

christmas

for
which
i
refused
to
pose
by
always
walking

maybe
i
ll
change
my
mind
when
i
am
amidst
all
the
wrapping
paper
that
once
covered

the
point
is

this

also
ask

has
your

done
this
before
has
the
client
given
the
shoot
enough
attention
to
guarantee
its
smooth
running
did
they
send
the
best
qualified
people
down
to
the
shoot
while
i
could
cheerfully
have
sacked
out
on
the
couch
for
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
with
my
snuggly
little
daughters
it
s
unwise
to
let
them
vegetate
in
front
of
the
television
for
extended
periods
so
i
hauled
myself
aloft
and
asked
if
either
of
them
would
like
to
do
a
craft
i
believe
they
may
have
actually
teleported
into
their
chairs
at
the
kitchen
table
which
i
took
as
an
affirmative
answer
and
quickly
assembled
a
few
oddments
i
had
handy
we
decided
to
make
angels
since
i
had
a
few
yards
of
white
tulle
some
fluff
that
looked
cloudlike
and
oodles
of
construction
paper
this
is
not
me
not
at
all
i
am
really
excited
for
them
just
imagining
them
finally
getting
to
take
their
baby
home
makes
me
smile
i
remember
the
drive
home
and
the
first
day
as
parents
on
our
own
and
there
was
a
sense
of
everything
being
right
in
the
world
i
do
not
think
i
ever
felt
more
at
peace
i
hope
ben
and
ali
get
to
experience
that
to
the
fullest
and
that
they
can
look
back
on
this
whole
experience
fondly
to
complete
my
card
i
stamped
my
sentiment
in
a

punched
a

you

i
have
my

finished
too
struggling
here
this
month
later
another
friend
c
picked
me
up
and
we
drove
to
a
place
where
a
woman
channels
spirit
guides
and
angels
i
sat
on
the
floor
and
my
friend
k
rested
her
feet
on
my
thigh
the
room
was
filled
with
women
a
few
men
i
had
never
met
most
of
whom
i
consider
my
friends
my
confidantes
the
people
i
laugh
with
have
called
crying
who
know
a
little
bit
about
every
little
nasty
bit
of
me
i
know
them
the
same
way
we
share
something
in
common
update
so
the
doc
ended
up
having
to
cut
me
open
i
had
a

if
you
get
squeamish
don
t
google
that

my

which
was
too
large
to
remove

surgery
took
about
2h
and
i
ll
be
in

till
sunday
i
ve
had

which
rocks
but
otherwise
the

is

will
then
be
going
on

on

did
you
hear
me
when
i
told
you
i
got
the
couch
two
chairs
and
the

for

bargain
i
think
i
paid
a
total
of
110
or
so
on
fabric
and
50
on
those

so
all
told
i

just
completed
a

with

for
phillips

and
the

immediately
after
their
arguments
at
the
federal
circuit
the
arguments
were
heavily
attended
at
the
federal
circuit
250
people
and
it
was
standing
room
only
while
nobody
was
ready
to
make
any
hard
and
fast
predictions
there
were
a
few
interesting
observations
that
were
made
about
the
oral
proceedings
a
friend
of
mission
of
hope
told
me
she
prays
for
us
often
and
added
she
thinks
i
have
the
coolest
job
what
i
will
say
is
that
we
bought
a
zoo
has
to
be
the
worst
case
of
botched
directing
i
ve
seen
in
a
long
time
the
actors
were
good
enough
to
rise
above
a
wretched
script
but
apparently
the
director
wasn
t
we
the
people
of
america
are
the
militia
those
that
call
us
terrorists
do
so
out
of
their
own
fear
and
at
their
own
peril
why
because
they
are
the
illegitimate
ones
the
consent
of
the
governed
is
slipping
away
from
them
the
onrushing
police
state
is
the
final
attempt
to
keep
the
power
and
the
stolen
goods
for
themselves
will
you
allow
your
children
and
grandchildren
to
bear
the
shame
of
the
german
nation
of
the
past
60
years
that
they
got
what
they
deserved
because
the
german
people
allowed
a
mad
man
and
his
satanic
cult
to
steal
their
nation
and
plunge
them
into
a
genocidal
war
i
used
to
like
the
way
she
would
run
out
into
the
morning
often
on
the
warmer
days
without
bothering
to
dress
in
the
clothes
i

the
flavor
and
texture
of
tomatoes
that
ripen
indoors
after
being
repeatedly
subjected
to
outdoor
temps
in
the
30s
are
less
than
ideal
but
they
are
much
better
than
no
tomatoes
and
still
miles
above
than
anything
you
can
buy
in
the
supermarket
especially
this
time
of
year
quickly
roasting
them
coaxes
out
lots
of
flavor

last

nolan
fans
reported
that
the
third
trailer
for
the
dark
knight
rises
will
be
attached
to
the
avengers
although
both
movies
are
made
by
different
studios
this
won
t
be
the
first
time
a
dc
trailer
has
preceeded
a
marvel
movie
in
2008
the
third
trailer
for
the
dark
knight
previewed
before

however
it
isn

gauranteed
that
every

of

will
feature

you
want
to
know
what
i
think
is
missing
from
irish
beer
bravery
with
just
a
few
exceptions
mostly
from
the
established
companies
we
are
still
stuck
in
the
stout

red

beermuda
triangle
of
traditional
irish
styles

now
we
have
a
hoppy

sticking
to

for

have
not
been
afraid
to
play
around
with
other
ideas
for
the
limited
editions
so
we
had
the

was

metalman
get
this
gong
for
giving
us
that
from
the
very
start
evolved
into
just
a
little
of
this
and
a
little
of
that
our
first
webinar
offered
a
quick
refresher
around
the
types
of
work
model
where
it
came
from
what
it
is
and
crucially
how
it
can
be
applied
in
a
variety
of
situations

well
this
fool
has
a
couple
of
dude
s
with
him
and
they
are
standing
around
all
serious
with
some
sort
of
devices
pointing
around
the
room
that
are
beeping
for
no
reason
and
then
this
guy
starts
yelling
at
me
high
levels
of
vitamins
and
native
oils
combine
for
soft
smooth
touchable
skin
not
all
employees
are
only
motivated
by
pay
bonuses
and
other
benefits
there
are
also
other
people
who
like
and
need
for
their
social
needs
to
be
met
at
work
they
are
also
looking
for
a
workplace
in
which
regardless
how
much
pressure
they
feel
or
how
difficult
the
job
is
they
don
t
get
burned
out
or
they
feel
like
they
re
not
even
working
at
all
a
google
search
took
me
to
the
wyoming
newspaper
project
and
i
found
a
gold
mine
in
those
oil
fields
it
was
purely
on
a
lark
that
i
typed
in
pecht
in
the
search
engine
and
got
more
than
200
hits
and
what
hits
they
were
every
one
one
of
these
newspaper
pages
referenced
the
families
of
my
great
grandfather
leroy
roy
pecht
and
his
brother
albert
blair
a
b
pecht
i
had
downloaded
more
than
80
newspaper
pages
with
articles
about
various
family
members
before
i
finally
called
it
quits
for
the
day
i
will
be
back
to
finish
up
later
or
how
about
this
tractor
at
the
macy
s
department
store
thanksgiving
day
parade
the
actor
playing
santa
is
discovered
to
be
by
a
whiskered
old
man
doris
walker
the
no
nonsense
special
events
director
persuades
the
old
man
to
take
his
place
the
old
man
proves
to
be
a
sensation
and
is
quickly
recruited
to
be
the
store
santa
at
the
main
macy
s
outlet
while
he
is
successful
ms
walker
learns
that
he
calls
himself
kris
kringle
and
he
claims
to
be
the
actual
santa
claus
despite
reassurances
by
kringle
s
doctor
that
he
is
harmless
doris
still
has
misgivings
especially
when
she
has
cynically
trained
herself
and
especially
her
daughter
susan
to
reject
all
notions
of
belief
and
fantasy
and
yet
people
especially
susan
begin
to
notice
there
is
something
special
about
kris
and
his
determination
to
advance
the
true
spirit
of
christmas
amidst
the
rampant
commercialism
around
him
and
succeeding
in
improbable
ways
when
a
raucous
conflict
with
the
store
s
cruelly
incompetent
psychologist
erupts
kris
finds
himself
held
at
bellevue
where
in
despair
he
deliberates
fails
a
mental
examination
to
ensure
his
commitment
all
seems
lost
until
doris
friend
fred
gaily
reassure
kris
of
his
worth
and
agrees
to
represent
him
in
the
fight
to
secure
his
release
to
achieve
that
fred
arranges
a
formal
hearing
in
which
he
argues
that
kris
is
sane
because
he
is
in
fact
santa
claus
what
ensues
is
a
bizarre
hearing
in
which
people
s
beliefs
are
reexamined
and
put
to
the
test
but
even
so
it
s
going
to
take
a
miracle
for
kris
to
win
vincent

something
similar
damning
the
deal
with
faint
praise
no
doubt
the
deal
enhances
the
probability
that

will
be
able
to
squeak
past

this
is
worth
thinking
about
but
i
do
not
believe
one
has
to
think
too
hard
to
come
to
the
right
conclusion
it
is
almost
unbelievable
scary
would
be
more
appropriate
that
this
could
happen
look
away
now
if
you
re
a
fan
of
rabbits
or
have
them
as
pets
as
this
post
probably
isn
t
for
you
some
may
say
it
s
cruel
even
perverse
to
cook
up
a
rabbit
dish
on
a
bank
holiday
weekend
which
has
for
its
mascot
a
giant
easter
egg
delivering
rabbit
well
i
had
rabbits
as
pets
when
i
was
younger
and
they
bit
me
a
lot
leaving
me
with
very
little
sympathy
towards
the
creatures
so
consider
this
revenge
pj
funny
bunny
and
the
er
one
whose
name
i
can
t
remember
plus
the
easter
bunny
brought
me
no
eggs
this
year
apparently
i
m
too
old
or
something
so
its
fair
to
say
i
m
not
a
fan
so
todays
dish
was
rabbit
bolognese
from
jamies
great
britain
which
i
m
now
renaming
easter
bunny
bolognese
and
had
me
up
at
7am
on
easter
monday
to
put
it
in
the
oven
because
this
bad
boy
takes
12
hours
to
cook
yes
12
i
know
but
after
20
minutes
prep
which
involved
browning
some
bacon
and
then
chucking
in
a
whole
rabbit
veg
herbs
tinned
tomatoes
and
beer
i
wisely
went
back
to
bed
to
enjoy
the
last
day
of
the
long
weekend
which
meant
waking
up
at
10
to
the
flat
filled
with
this
amazing
aroma
that
made
me
wish
it
could
have
been
cooked
in
half
the
time
as
the
cereal
i
had
for
breakfast
really
didn
t
suppress
the
appetite
this
smell
was
creating
after
12
hours
jamie
instructed
me
to
let
it
cool
for
a
little
while
and
then
to
don
a
pair
of
rubber
gloves
and
start
scrunching
all
the
veg
and
the
meat
so
that
it
turned
into
mush
the
onions
and
veg
were
all
put
in
whole
at
the
start
and
also
to
remove
all
the
bones
from
the
rabbit
this
was
tricky
as
even
after
cooling
down
for
half
hour
it
was
still
very
hot
and
no
matter
how
much
you
look
you
will
find
small
bits
of
bone
while
you
re
eating
the
bolognese
i
could
have
left
it
to
cool
for
a
little
while
longer
but
by
this
time
it
was
7
30
and
i
was
very
hungry
heat
won
t
stop
me
when
my
tummy
s
rumbling
the
verdict
well
it
really
wasn
t
too
impressive
considering
it
took
so
long
to
cook
and
nearly
burnt
through
the
rubber
gloves
to
my
poor
hands
while
i
do
like
jamie
olivers
recipes
in
general
sometimes
i
think
he
forgets
that
people
aren
t
chefs
and
don
t
always
have
time
inclination
money
to
cook
his
long
winded
recipes
i
don
t
know
about
everyone
else
but
if
i
m
going
to
have
to
smell
deliciousness
for
12
hours
and
then
nearly
burn
my
hands
i
m
going
to
want
the
taste
to
be
just
as
good
as
the
smell
at
the
end
of
the
day
he
s
a
chef
and
you
can
tell
this
when
comparing
his
recipes
to
home
cooks
like
nigella
nigellas
recipes
keep
working
busy
people
fully
in
mind
whereas
i
feel
jamie
gets
so
caught
up
in
his
own
passion
for
food
that
he
forgets
not
everyone
is
so
enthusiastic
or
if
they
are
they
still
aren
t
chefs
and
want
things
to
be
simple
and
tasty
don
t
even
get
me
started
on
jamies
30
minute
meals
book
i
could
be
here
all
day
i
ll
save
that
for
another
post
though
possibly
when
i
cook
from
that
very
book
at
the
end
of
the
day
i
ve
made
much
better
bolognese
sauces
or
ragus
from
scratch
in
the
past
and
it
didn
t
take
as
long
and
tasted
a
great
deal
nicer
there
is
absolutely
loads
of
this
left
as
well
which
i
m
a
bit
gutted
about
as
i
don
t
have
any
desire
to
eat
it
again
but
will
not
throw
away
it
ll
probably
end
up
in
the
freezer
for
several
years
now
shame
out
in
the
andromeda
out
in
the
hybrid
galaxy
the
hypotenuse
writhed
around
her
own
shoulder
she
writhed
inside
her
horrible
backward
body
she
writhed
so
that
her
insides
chafed
against
the
shell
so
that
her
muscles
rubbed
raw
agains
the
inside
of
her

supporting
prenatal
testing
because
on
s
planet
prenatal
testing
is
a
tool
designed
by
heathens
to
do
away
with
all
detectable
disabilities
in
the
real
world
prenatal
testing
allows
expecting
parents
to
know
the
detectable
health
status
of
their
pregnancy
who
can
see
it
and
who
cares
certainly
not
me
why
a
writing
notebook
you
may
ask
why
not
just
tip
tap
type
away
on
my
laptop
my
answer
is
simple
you
need
it
writing
with
a
pen
or
pencil
is
completely
different
from
typing
on
a
computer
it
uses
different
parts
of
your
body
different
parts
of
your
brain
i
taught
college
for
a
long
time
and
i
was
always
fascinated
by
a
roomful
of
students
taking
an
essay
test
as
their
pencils
moved
their
whole
bodies
became
involved
in
the
writing
process
some
bobbed
their
heads
some
hunched
over
some
moved
their
mouths
as
if
speaking
the
words
some
slid
right
to
the
edge
of
their
chairs
almost
as
if
they
were
about
to
hop
up
and
chase
after
the
elusive
perfect
phrase
we
do
not
use
our
whole
bodies
in
the
same
way
when
we
type
and
we
certainly
do
not
use
our
brains
in
the
same
way
writing
by
hand
is
messy
business
when
our
hand
moves
across
the
page
there
is
a
direct
physical
connection
between
thought
and
hand
and
pen
and
page
we
are
touching
our
thoughts
tracing
them
shaping
them
into
being
almost
like
a
sculptor
i
am
talking
magic
and
that
is
just
what
we
need
to
do
some
serious
writing
so
if
you
feel
like
working
on
your
writing
this
winter
get
yourself
a
writing
notebook
or
start
a
new
one
special
just
for
2011
if
you
feel
artsy
decorate
it
if
you
can
not
be
bothered
with
that
leave
it
plain
but
do
put
your
name
and
email
address
on
it
and
do
write
somewhere
on
the
inside
cover
a
dollar
amount
award
for
its
recovery
if
lost
make
it
have
value
right
from
the
start
make
it
your
very
own
now
i
was
never
in
any
real
danger
another
couple
of
feet
and
he
would
have
recognized
me
at
the
very
least
as
the
girl
with
the
hotdogs
not
as
cool
as
the
girl
who
was
on
fire
but
i
ll
take
what
i
can
get
she
took
her
hand
away
but
it
was
still
night
time
and
cloudy
moonless
only
the
distant
fire
somehow
now
high
above
them
shone
muted
by
the
sherim's
depths
better
not
to
twist
around
and
try
to
get
a
look
at
their
predator
doing
so
would
only
risk
his
place
in
the
sherim
still
he
could
at
least
do
something
about
taslin's
embrace
people
use
humour
to
deal
with
all
sorts
of
things
including
tragedy
i
as
regular
readers
all
know
have
suffered
from
depression
for
the
better
part
of
my
life
but
i
don
t
find
that
my
humour
suffers
when
i
m
depressed
if
anything
and
i
even
mentioned
this
to
my
doctor
i
d
say
it
improves
he
had
no
answer
for
that
i
wrote
my
first
two
novels
while
deeply
depressed
and
they
re
full
of
humorous
situations
i
favour
dry
humour
delivered
deadpan
i
take
especial
pleasure
in
wordplay
but
with
the
exception
of
slapstick
there
s
not
much
i
don
t
enjoy
when
it
comes
to
comedy
i
have
a

of
the
late
great

second
does
it

any
connection
with
appearance
as
we
have
seen
in
the
previous
paragraph
it
does
does
the
clothing
have
to
meet
a
certain
standard
the
only
standard
that
i
am
aware
is
that
standard
that
expresses
itself
in
godliness
there
is
no
certain
length
to
a
skirt
no
certain
arrangement
to
a
blouse
top
and
neither
is
there
an
exhortation
that
a
man
must
wear
a
shirt
but
there
is
a
connection
to
apparel
that
has
propriety
in
view
something
that
is
respectable
suitable
and
decent
in
the
end
the
individual
will
have
to
judge
what
is
best
but
they
need
to
do
so
in
accordance
with
godliness
if
one
does
not
use
this
standard
then
the
only
standard
remaining
is
one
s
own
can
one
be
pleasing
to
with
such
a
standard
moreover
if
godliness
has
its
start
in
the
heart
it
can
t
help
but
to
come
out
in
the
appearance
he
was
okay
with
all
the
consequences
which
of
course
to
me
meant
that
none
of
them
were
good
enough
then
i
told
him
he
was
going
to
have
to
write
an
apology
letter
to
the
principal
and
deliver
it
to
him
personally
well
that
was
it
the
angry
flood
of
tears
shouting
and
horror
began
yes
at
last
i
had
found
something
that
was
going
to
work
she
has
found
a
way
to
make
school
serve
her
purpose
which
i
think
is
a
good
thing
but
i
wonder
how
long
will
that
last
i
made
it
to
round
2
thank
you
all
for
your
support
and
had
to
do
another
video
that
you
can
see
here
the
parents
would
freak
of
course
a
mohel
with
parkinson's
and
just
to
get
rid
of
him
would
hand
shecky
a
check
for
125
shecky
would
apologize
say
he
was
steady
as
a
rock
really
but
in
the
end
he'd
take
the
money
a
few
sandwiches
and
run
have
you
ever
wished
you
could
make
yourself
look
less
tired
in
a
photo
or
wanted
to
remove
a
blemish
that
popped
up
the
morning
it
was
taken
did
the
lighting
make
your
under
eye
circles
look
even
worse
than
they
really
are
well
you
can
easily
fix
all
of
that
in
digital
photos
and
i
show
you
how
in
less
than
10
minutes
just
the
very
thought
of
hosting
a
party
thrills
me
to
my
very
fingertips
and
right
out
to
my
toes
once
i
have
settled
on
a
theme
my
mind
goes
into
an
absurd
state
of
overdrive
as
i
get
more
enthused
about
the
creative
possibilities
the
visions
build
and
build
and
build
shame
the
budget
does
not
my
family
and
friends
generally
groan
largely
because
i
get
a
bit
over
the
top
in
my
plans
and
then
need
to
call
for
support
only
once
i
have
agreed
to
admit
the
absurdity
and
pare
back
none
the
less
everyone
does
enjoy
themselves
even
the
ridiculous
dress
up
themes
saturday
morning
i
decided
i
would
finish
trimming
and
hauling
the
holly
hedge
this
is
an
undertaking
because
it
is
2oo
linear
feet
of
hedges
and
uphill
hauling
as
the
clock
rolled
around
to
mid
afternoon
i
noticed
some
of
the
bushes
were
looking
droopy
this
is
not
a
good
sign
i
never
get
too
worried
when
the
annuals
go
to
drooping
but
when
the
shade
growing
bushes
get
the
droop
it
is
an
indication
of
urgent
need
so
i
turned
the
sprinklers
on
and
went
to
fetch
bags
of
mulch
now
since
he
was
feeling
much
better
he
decided
to
give
a
thought
about
his
restless
behaviour
he
asked
himself
as
to
why
was
he
tensed
for
a
petty
little
thing
because
this
was
not
the
first
time
there
have
been
instances
like
this
before
just
a
week
ago
iqra
had
gone
off
to
sleep
while
doing
her
project
work
he
was
expecting
a
call
or
text
from
her
at
that
time
too
but
when
he
didn
t
receive
one
he
went
off
to
sleep
himself
so
why
this
restlessness
now
louise
meintjes
 
sound
of
africa
documents
the
making
of
isigqi's
1992
album
by
placing
it
within
the
context
of
south
africa's
political
history
and
the
lineage
of
mbaqanga
music
itself
the
only
major
flaw
with
the
book
is
not
the
text
it
is
the
fact
that
a
copy
of
lomculo
unzima
was
not
included
with
the
finished
work
long
out
of
print
this
album
is
presented
to
you
by
electric
jive
in
the
hope
of
plugging
something
of
a
gap
that
has
remained
unfilled
heretofore
although
the
material
here
does
stray
quite
a
bit
from
ej's
usual
focus
we
are
sharing
this
recording
not
only
to
assist
the
ongoing
internet
documentation
of
all
south
african
musics
but
to
bring
added
colour
to
the
words
of
meintjes
 
book
and
to
bring
the
voices
of
jane
dlamini
joana
thango
and
janet
dlamini
and
every
musician
associated
with
them
to
life
and
when
i
achieved
this
feat
maybe
this
is
how
it
is
for
the
those
who
swear
by
the
power
of
positive
thinking
it
was
for
me
a
time
of
easy
living
and
no
cares
because
as
i
have
said
everything
worked
when
it
all
inevitably
fell
apart
and
i
lost
everything
i
worked
so
hard
for
the
world
still
carried
on
was
still
up
was
still
in
deep
but
i
hadn
t
noticed
that
when
i
was
carried
aloft
in
the
flow
of
fortune
being
given
what
i
wanted
somehow
cast
an
impenetrable
curtain
before
my
eyes
that
blinded
me
to
the
disgusting
horrible
that
was
going
down
in
the
world
all
around
me
as
the
reversal
of
fortune
swept
me
away
in
the
other
direction
i
was
able
to
the
others
who
were
being
swept
away
along
that
same
black
tide
far
far
worse
off
than
me
the
curtain
that
was
so
effective
in
allowing
me
to
expect
to
live
a
happy
fulfilling
life
without
regards
to
others
was
beginning
to
come
down
metaphors
may
also
be
used
in
ways
that
introduce
bias
to
mainstream
news
but
often
go
unnoticed
because
they
are
so
engrained
in
the
way
that
we
speak
otto
santa
ana
discusses
the
ways
in
which
language
used
by
the
media
can
create
and
maintain
negative
images
of
groups
of
people
in
his
book
brown
tide
rising
there
was
only
mummy
and
princess
at
home
last
night
after
kakak
left
for
the
day
and
out
of
a
sudden
princess
came
to
mummy
and
hugged
mummy
then
she
whisper
happy
mothers
 
day
mummy
mummy
went
like
 
huh
 
you
are
so
easily
able
to
express
your
thoughts
or
ideas
by
explaining
i
know
that
can
seem
like
a
burden
but
it
is
amazing
to
see
you
use
it
for
good
that
is
what
you
do
use
your
gift
for
good

did
tell

the

this

is
truly
my

as
it
has
had
a
place
next
to
my
computer
from
the
very
beginning
from
outlining
to
revising
the
third
draft
i
have
relied
on
my
muse
juice
to
keep
me
focused
and
relaxed
besides
that
its
chocolate
coffee
what
more
could
i
want
in
life
for
years
people
have

a
response
dwarfed
the
international

day
haiku
contest
and
simply
blew
away
the
drinkdrank
facebook
fan
page
photo
contest
the
number
of
entries
was
simply
staggering
this
go
round
okay
that
last
bit
may
have
been
a
little
over
the
top
but
anyway
check
out
what
came
in
i
sat
cross
legged
and
felt
at
one
with
the
universe
lol
the
thought
exploded
in
my
mind
that
everything
was
connected
everything
was
one
there
was
no
separation
and
that
if
everything
in
the
universe
was
connected
and
one
then
there
was
nothing
to
fear
i
pondered
this
for
a
while
and
it
made
sense
to
me
i
felt
like
i
had
just
been
given
one
of
the
secrets
of
the
universe
then
i
suddenly
heard
a
rattle
sound
coming
from
directly
in
front
of
me
about
20
feet
away
i
opened
my
eyes
and
was
startled
and
wondered
what
could
be
making
that
noise
i
knew
that
rattlesnakes
were
common
in
these
hills
but
this
was
no
rattlesnake
then
i
heard
the
noise
again
this
time
coming
from
the
right
of
me
still
out
about
20
feet
away
i
thought
maybe
someone
was
playing
a
trick
on
me
but
i
realized
that
there
was
no
one
out
here
i
was
alone
and
besides
how
could
a
person
move
noiselessly
through
the
chaparral
without
me
hearing
them
i
was
getting
sacred
and
wondered
what
was
going
on
then
i
heard
the
noise
except
this
time
it
was
directly
behind
me
then
again
in
front
except
this
time
it
was
closer
the
noise
grew
louder
and
louder
as
it
continued
to
circle
me
i
suddenly
became
very
afraid
and
my
mind
raced
back
to
the
carlos
castaneda
books
that
talked
of
encounters
with
spirit
beings
similar
to
the
one
i
was
encountering
now
whatever
it
was
circled
again
growing
closer
with
each
pass
that
it
made
then
it
was
right
in
front
of
me
now
remember
that
at
this
point
i
was
still
sitting
cross
legged
on
the
ground
something
came
at
me
and
gently
pushed
me
backward
and
held
me
there
if
you
were
in
the
lotus
position
this
is
impossible
to
do
as
the
weight
of
your
upper
body
would
tilt
you
and
you
would
fall
over
backward
this
was
not
the
case
though
this
demonic
spirit
i
call
it
that
because
that
is
what
it
was
held
me
there
for
a
while
and
then
slowly
let
me
up
once
it
did
i
jumped
to
my
feet
and
started
slamming
my
open
palm
against
my
thigh
this
was
a
technique
that
i
had
read
about
from
castaneda
who
used
it
when
a
spirit
that
he
did
not
want
to
deal
with
would
come
to
him
this
action
would
apparently
repel
the
spirit
once
i
had
done
this
another
thought
came
into
my
mind
and
it
said
that
if
i
had
opened
myself
up
to
the
spirit
it
would
have
been
able
to
take
me
out
of
my
body
and
shown
me
the
secrets
of
the
universe
if
you
are
inclined
to
make
a
donation
could
i
make
a
plea
on
behalf
of
the
rda
keepin
eyes
opened
and
heart
in
its
case
ready
to
absorb
all
i
can
on
this
journey
back
to
the
planters
there
i
go
again
anyway
i
sculpted
my
planters
using
stoneware
clay
fired
them
in
the
kiln
at
a
high
temperature
and
then
adorned
them
with
all
sorts
of
embellishments
i
had
in
my
studio
let
us
all
join
in
this
united
legion
in
this
tsunami
of
change
yes
it
is
the
universal
law
but
let
us
also
say
change
does
not
equal
chaos
it
does
not
need
to
it
does
need
to
result
in
you
feeling
displaced
lift
it
up
and
put
in
a
better
place
yes
that
is
important
for
all
of
you
but
not
displaced
and
certainly
never
endangered
the
mother
s
plan
of
unfoldment
does
not
include
endangering
those
she
cherishes
23
sculptors
what
it
is
a
5k
run
walk
approximately
3
1
miles
you
can
run
walk
or
skip
it
s
up
to
you
there
s
no
time
limit
and
there
s
just
one
requirement
that
you
participate
you
can
do
it
inside
or
outside
on
a
treadmill
or
on
a
track
or
even
do
a
swim
or
a
bike
ride
instead
of
running
walking
just
get
moving
this
photo
shoot
was
instead
the
turning
point
of
my
life
the
experience
of
being
a
model
seems
enchanting
yet
controversial
to
my
nerdy
life
hoverer
the
amount
of
satisfaction
i
have
earned
from
my
first
shoot
was
significant
enough
to
inspire
me
to
be
a
top
model
the
space
is
small
somehow
it
looks
bigger
on
camera
and
keeping
it
rather
simple
further
tricks
the
eye
into
believing
it
is
more
spacious
still
i
would
love
a
place
to
put
a
bottle
of
wine
or
a
casserole
dish
mid
meal
without
crowding
the
table
or
having
to
run
to
the
kitchen
counter
every
ten
minutes
not
that
the
kitchen
is
far
but
who
likes
their
host
dashing
back
and
forth
the
whole
meal
a
handy
surface
would
make
life
easier
but
with
such
cramped
quarters
the
options
are
limited
the
chair
touches
the
wall
under
the
painting
when
pulled
out
so
anything
would
have
to
be
really
tucked
into
that
corner
to
the
right
and
pretty
small
so
folks
can
still
squeeze
by
in
a
couple
of
days
it
will
mark
my
one
year
anniversary
of
living
in
san
francisco
when
i
graduated
college
i
wanted
to
live
work
in
one
of
three
cities
sf
nyc
or
london
fortunately
i
got
myself
a
job
in
sf
and
have
been
here
since
anyway
on
that
sweeping
generalisation
i
shall
go
to
bed
good
night
and
it
is
very
nice
to
be
back
this
year
the
murrells
the
lewises
joined
us
and
so
this
weekend
i
filled
my
empty
pallet
with
the
likes
of
petunias
purple
sage
and
parsley
to
make
a
pallet
garden
you
ll
need
a
variety
of
2
inch
starters
a
staple
gun
and
staples
a
pallet
landscaping
fabric
and
2
giant
bags
of
potting
soil
cover
the
back
bottom
and
sides
of
the
pallet
with
the
landscaping
fabric
making
sure
to
staple
all
the
loose
ends
along
the
way
then
the
congress
of
vienna
met
which
brought
together
all
the
heads
of
state
to
decide
the
future
of
europe
after
napoleon
this
was
one
of
beethoven
s
moments
of
glory
he
was
invited
to
play
many
times
bringing
him
recognition
and
admiration
of
which
he
could
be
truly
proud
it
is
kind
of
hard
to
explain
why
i
wanted
to
see
the
vatican
splendors
exhibit
at
the
minnesota
history
center
of
course
i
wanted
to
experience
the
art
and
the
dazzling
ancient
treasures
but
this
seemed
personal
somehow
due
in
part
i
am
sure
to
having
been
raised
catholic
whatever
my
experience
with
the
church
whatever
my
current
beliefs
or
spiritual
practices
that
will
never
leave
me
and
i
will
always
have
immediate
response
to
it
on
a
soul
level
there
are
many
other
examples
of
time
not
being
consistent
with
brilliant
physicist
daniel
faraday's
payload
arriving
to
the
island
after
being
launched
from
the
freighter
and
with
the
time
of
death
with
dr
ray
arriving
to
the
island
after
being
killed
on
the
freighter
and
i
always
found
it
interesting
that
lapidus
needed
to
follow
a
bearing
to
fly
to
the
freighter
which
of
course
shows
us
desmond
having
his
amazing
flashes
and
the
305
bearing
had
to
be
followed
when
traveling
by
raft
in
cabin
fever
in
a
medium
sized
bowl
add
all
ingredients
except
sour
cream
mix
well
add
the
sour
cream
and
mix
again
serve
cold
with
crackers
or
chips
beer
just
super
murky
sort
of
a
terrible
nose
too
reminiscent
of
dishwater
which
is
never
good
i
think
it
was
a
mix
of
the
hops
from
the
base
beer
as
i
have
smelled
it
before
on
some
of
their
beers
regardless
of
why
it
smelled
like
it
did
it
did
not
make
me
terribly
interested
in
drinking
it
started
watery
with
some
slight
funk
but
nothing
much
else
it
did
not
grow
on
itself
like
the
others
nor
did
it
make
me
want
to
keep
drinking
more
not
everything
can
be
a
winner
though
so
we
will
just
scratch
this
as
experimentation
gone
wrong
of
course
some
people
would
probably
disagree
with
me
and
thought
it
was
good
so
realize
this
is
just
my
opinion
of
it
then
it
was
down
to
the
tranquil
sun
drenched
garden
of
place
louis
achille
one
of
my
favourite
hidden
gardens
in
the
marais
it
was
deserted
just
me

little
man
who
was
slumbering
in
the
pram

hallelujah

although
it
s
not

to
be
behind
the
story
that

the
young
men
made
a
sacrifice
probably
because
instructed
the
first
family
to
do
so
sacrifice
meant
shedding
of
blood
we
learn
said
without
the
shedding
of
blood
there
is
no
remission
of
sin

it

the
bottomline

are
you
at
the

leaders

full
of
effective
tips
essential
to

these

are

voice

specific

seekers
are
flooding
the
megacity
bombay
daily
from
the
various
provinces
many
of
them
are
living
and
working
at
countless
large
construction
sites
in
the
city
it
all
started
with
jawaharlal
nehru
who
was
the
first
prime
minister
of
india
after
independence
from
britain
nehru's
only
daughter
was
indira
gandhi
who
had
two
stints
as
prime
minister
before
being
assassinated
in
1984
her
elder
son
rajiv
succeeded
he
lost
an
election
and
was
later
assassinated
in
1991
her
other
son
sanjay
also
had
a
ton
of
political
power
but
never
held
office
and
died
in
a
plane
crash
in
1980
rajiv's
wife
sonia
then
became
involved
in
politics
and
now
leads
the
congress
party
in
india
many
believe
she
is
the
most
powerful
person
in
the
country
her
son
rahul
is
the
heir
apparent
to
this
political
dynasty
and
is
currently
a
prominent
member
of
parliament
a

ghagara
sarpanch
banodini
parida
did
not
allow
any
development
work
to
take
place
including
connection
of
a
government
sponsored
water
pipe
line
in
a
dalit
ward
of
the
panchayat
at
the
behest
of
her
father
balaram
parida
balaram
blocked
the
pipe
water
project
in
the
ward
for
avenging
on
the
residents
who
did
not
cast
their
votes
to
her
daughter
because
the
museum
is
not
owned
by
the
state
or
federal
parks
system
and
therefore
relies
on
private
donations
and
admission
fees
to
keep
it
up
and
running
some
of
the
exhibits
were
more
accessible
than
others
becky
thatcher's
house
for
example
was
completely
closed
for
renovation
and
others
were
in
need
of
some
repair
and
updating
however
it
was
very
interesting
to
learn
about
mark
twain's
early
life
and
see
some
of
the
places
that
inspired
the
novels
all
weekend
j
and
i
both
remarked
that
we
needed
to
go
back
and
reread
the
adventures
of
tom
sawyer
again
after
everything
we
had
read
and
seen
don

pursuing

that

not

charondigliani

was
clearly
an
inspiration
behind
this
work
no
automobile

was
used
in
this
but
charondigliani
did
use
some
chalk
to
create
that
subtle
translucence
so
necessary

suggest
a
degree
of

there

really
pays
off
to
have
studied
in

10
years
i
got
to
keep
a
solid
set
of

and
nothing
much
has
changed
over
the
years
well
except
for
our
different
career
paths
but
other
than
that
we
are
basically

that
all

the

they
battle
together

resentment
and

surface
and
play
a
part
in

a
victor
almost
as
much
as
forgiveness
of

needless
to

it
ends
in
what
is
perhaps

never

the
registration
point
for
this

isn

important
but
my
point
here
in
remembering
joiner
here
is
not
his
greatness
but
his
timing
even
though
he
never
has
a
season
where
he
led
the
league
in
receptions
yards
or
receiving
touchdowns
and
never
really
came
all
that
close
made
only
one
all
pro
team
and
was
often
even
in
his
best
years
the
second
or
third
best
receiver
on
his
own
team
behind
kellen
winslow
wes
chandler
or
john
jefferson
he
was
inducted
in
the
hall
of
fame
in
1996
in
part
because
of
his
amazing
consistency
and
durability
he
played
18
years
and
in
part
i
would
say
because
he
held
the
record
for
most
receptions
and
receiving
yards
when
he
retired
changing
words
he
initiated
the
akshaya
patra
program
to
provide
mid
day
meals
to
underprivileged
children
in
the
government

of

a

farther
back

less

you
could
make
a

i
can
even
do
something
beforehand
to
postpone
or
hopefully
terminate
those
feelings
before
they
arise
i
have
a
hard
time
believing
that
we
are
at
the
one
year
mark
since
max's
kidney
transplant
i
still
have
to
remind
myself
of
the
rollercoaster
ride
that
we
were
on
just
a
short
year
ago
believe
it
or
not
i
barely
remember
life
before
july
8
2010
the
dialysis
and
endless
meds
seem
like
a
lifetime
ago
fighting
to
keep
max
alive
was
what
got
us
out
of
bed
every
day
when
i
look
back
on
some
of
my
past
blog
posts
i
have
a
hard
time
believing
that
that
was
me
writing
those
words
i
feel
like
i
am
looking
into
someone
else's
life
and
can
not
believe
what
that
family
has
gone
through
to
get
their
little
boy
to
where
he
is
today
then
i
realize
that
that
was
our
life
all
of
the
surgeries
hospital
stays
and
visits
dialysis
treatments
tests
therapy
sessions
blood
draws
the
sleepless
nights
and
all
of
the
tears
we
lived
that
not
only
did
we
live
it
but
we
survived
it
and
i
am
so
proud
of
who
we
have
become
because
of
the
journey
that
we
chose
to
live
it
was
a
journey
of
struggle
and
heartache
but
it
was
also
a
journey
of
determination
and
love
for
one
little
boy
a
little
boy
who
has
taught
us
more
in
his
three
years
of
life
than
we
have
learned
in
our
28
30
years
of

go

do
my

so
here
s
what
i
think
men
don
t
be
afraid
to
be
put
in
the
friend
zone
dude
you
re
getting
a
friendship
with
a
cool
woman
who
can
offer
you
fun
times
great
conversations
and
perspectives
on
life
and
love
you
might
otherwise
miss
out
on
it
s
something
to
be
cherished
you
will
find
another
woman
who
will
be
willing
to
jump
in
the
sack
with
you
heck
your
friend
might
introduce
you
one
day
brumsky
funnily
enough
just
the
other
day
i
was
talking
to
a
neighbour
monsieur
bosquet
who
pointed
out
that
this
is
an
exceptional
year
for
the
morel
mushroom
and
inquired
as
to
whether
i
had
seen
any
i
really
liked
this
saisons
are
supposed
to
pair
well
with
lots
of
food
i
ate
some
flavor
x
treme
cheddar
goldfish
with
this
and
thought
it
was
excellent
sour
crisp
ale
and
salty
cheesey
crackers
it
is
good
for
me
which
brings
me
to
the
social
media
time
as
an
author
i
know
how
important
self
promotion
is
but
it
takes
up
so
much
time
it
also
is
a
fine
line
between
look
at
me
look
at
me
and
simply
being
present
i
have
to
admit
i
am
shy
when
it
comes
to
social
media
i
m
much
more
of
a
stalker
than
a
tweeter
or
a
poster
on
facebook
i
try
to
post
but
i
can
t
seem
to
find
anything
witty
enough
to
say
i
need
a
good
hash
tag
any
suggestions
on
one
i
can
start
i
see
a
lot
of
authors
doing
clever
lines
about
their
books
i
love
that
i
don
t
like
it
when
they
just
repeat
verbatim
excerpts
from
their
books
over
and
over
again
blatant
self
promotion
is
not
my
thing
then
how
is
she
managing
it
all
own
her
own
judy
admits
she
would
not
have
been
able
to
start
up
at
all
without
winning
the
nesta
founding
called
starter
for
six
and
the
jolomo
award
she
learned
a
lot
of
what
she
knows
about
business
from
nesta
support
where
she
got
lectures
on
things
like
cash
flow
and
yearly
projections
something
i
think
we
all
accept
at
this
stage
we
know
nothing
about
she
jokes
as
long
as
you
keep
all
your
invoices
extremely
organised
and
can
bribe
a
friend
to
help
you
you
ll
be
fine
nesta
provides
you
with
enough
money
to
start
up
but
she
says
she
would
advise
us
to
try
to
not
to
spend
so
much
money
when
just
starting
out
after
nesta
she
entered
the
jolomo
award
an
award
set
up
by
the
artist
john
lowrie
morrison
to
encourage
and
recognise
young
emerging
talent
she
said
she
was
completely
broke
before
jolomo
so
has
always
described
it
as
the
stepping
stone
to
her
career
come
on
that
is
just
12

was
an
interesting
result
to
this
first
only
one
person
got
it
right
second
of
those
who
got
it
wrong
everyone
apart
from
one
thought
the
correct
answer
was
josie
and
third
something
a
bit
odd
and
wastedesque
has
happened
see
when
i
thought
of
the
two
wrong
options
of
josie
and
laura
i
thought
i
was
doing
it
purely
randomly
just
picking
names
out
of
my
head
and
they
could
have
been
anything
then
i
forgot
about
it
a
few
days
ago
i
started
writing
a
new
book
i
could
not
think
of
the
character's
name
at
first
and
then
the
name
i
chose
was
josie
again
thinking
it
was
just
any
name
only
when
i
looked
at
all
the
competition
entries
last
night
did
i
realise
that
a
josie
was
one
of
the
false
options
i'd
given
you
and
b
that
everyone
apart
from
two
of
you
would
think
that
was
the
correct
answer
did
ye
never
hear
yon
sound
afore
said
osie
to
me
interrupting
so
the

cackled

stranger
things
than
thee
my
hairy
one
whatcha
want
for
the
port

the
no

alternative
is
unacceptable
maintaining
the
status
quo
would
lead
to
almost
a
33
percent
increase
in

and
associated
costs
in

city
according
to
laura
shabe
port

manager
of

i
wanted
to
say
goodbye
to
it
i
was
the
2010
2011
wilber
czech
queen
for
my
hometown
it
was
an
experience
that
is
a
life
changer
i
traveled
to
many
new
places
and
got
to
meet
a
ton
of
new
people
i
wanted
to
do
a
little
review
over
it
to
fill
all
of
you
in
on
all
the
things
that
happened
that
year
so
here's
my
story
fifth
that
jerusalem
was
actually
destroyed
by
nebuchadnezzar
s
armies
in
607
bc
the
date
for
jerusalem
s
destruction
is
one
of
the
most
accurately
fixed
of
ancient
history
more
significantly
the
historical
sources
that
establish
the
date
for
babylon
s
fall
in
539
bc
which
date
the
watchtower
society
does
accept
and
in
fact
which
it
uses
as
the
starting
point
for
its
1914
calculations
are
exactly
the
same
sources
that
establish
587
6
bc
as
the
date
for
jerusalem
s
destruction
several
independent
lines
of
evidence
historical
astronomical
archeological
etc
point
to
the
date
of
587
86
bc
not
607
bc
as
the
date
of
jerusalem
s
destruction
there
is
not
a
single
line
of
historical
evidence
which
supports
the
607
bc
date
see

team
boom
vs

truth
kicked
the
show
off
and
the
match
was
good
but
we
had
a
ending
that
s
okay
because
it
s
not
the
end
of
the
feud
with
these
four
men
q
how
many
liberals
does
it
take
to
change
a
light
bulb
when
jesus
addressed
his
disciples
he
instructed
each
of
them
that
they
must
deny
himself
take
up
his
cross
daily
and
follow
me
jesus
message
is
clear
to
us
all
in
order
to
follow
him
we
must
have
the
same
attitude
toward
life
and
death
that
he
had
each
one
us
must
deny
ourselves
that
is
not
think
selfishly
about
ourselves
but
look
out
for
and
towards
others
you
must
be
prepared
to
take
up
your
cross
daily
that
is
you
must
have
total
and
daily
commitment
in
order
to
survive
the
path
of
rejection
that
comes
with
following
jesus

okay
so
i
am
starting
to
regret
taking
weekly
pictures
s
remember
the
camera
adds
10
pounds
but
extended
family
it
could
be
you
we
weren
t
the
only
ones
waiting
there
on
the
beautiful
saturday
morning
there
were
a
couple
of
tourists
some
guys
on
old
trucks
probably
locals
once
we
were
allowed
to
go
we
passed
that
part
that
clearly
was
in
the
need
of
repair
parked
on
a
side
of
the
road
just
across
from
albee
creek
campground
packed
up
and
went
off
on
the
trail
sort
of
into
the
blaze
of
death
we
wear
the
mask
let
the
years
pass
unnoticed
get
a
career
not
a
job
buy
a
house
have
two
striking
children
try
to
raise
them
well
fail
frequently
lapse
into
a
bored
indifference
lapse
into
an
indifferent
sadness
have
a
mid
life
crisis
grow
old
wonder
at
your
lack
of
achievement
feel
sometimes
contented
but
mostly
vacant
and
ethereal
feel
during
walks
as
if
you
might
never
return
or
as
if
you
might
blow
away
on
the
wind
contract
a
terminal
illness
die
but
only
after
you
observe
that
the
girl
who
didn
t
read
never
made
your
heart
oscillate
with
any
significant
passion
that
no
one
will
write
the
story
of
your
lives
and
that
she
will
die
too
with
only
a
mild
and
tempered
regret
that
nothing
ever
came
of
her
capacity
to
love
here's
the
thing
however
i
pick
up
the
movie
to
read
the
back
cover
and
see
what
extras
documentaries
this
and
that
are
contained
therein
and
i
hear
that
thing
that
any
dvd
purchaser
collector
dreads
to
hear
when
they
pick
up
a
dvd
case
bloemfontein

the

said
on
thursday
many
sites
provide
badges
little
graphics
that
represent
the
site
or
some
achievement
to
supporters
who
then
post
them
on
their
blogs
or
other
sites
one
example
of
this
is
on
linkedin
when
you
join
a
linkedin
group
you
have
the
option
to
display
the
group
s
badge
on
your
profile
so
others
see
you
re
a
member
badges
are
also
given
by
sites
like
foursquare
to
signify
some
achievement
or
status
it
s
a
good
way
to
enable
and
encourage
evangelists
there
are
also
other
types
of
badges
that
recognize
achieve
ments
of
your
supporters
such
as
top
blogger
or
most
valuable
evangelist
there
s
now
a
small
gap
where
they
need
to
wait
for
the
votes
to
come
in
lines
close
at
9pm
so
the
compare
is
on
stage
and
working
the
studio
nicely
he
has
four
signed
cue
cards
and
is
playing
a
game
of
who
s
the
biggest
fan
to
determin
who
should
get
them
he
s
having
music
from
the
four
coaches
played
and
the
people
who
know
all
the
lyrics
or
who
are
dancing
most
energetically
will
be
the
winners
it
s
fun
to
watch
if
nothing
else
he
keeps
the
audience
engaged
while
we
wait
and
nothing
is
going
on
nellymary
has
a
post
on
making
citrus

which
is
a
good
old

her
post
is
here
you
can
make
a
similar
cleaner
using
lavender
leaves
and
flowers

for
the
australians

singapore
do
have
lots
of
smaller
fan
made
conventions
such
as
cosfest
and
eoy
which
i
never
attend
because
their
main
attractions
are
cosplay
which
to
be
frank
is
something
i
kinda
dislike
about
the
anime
community
however
2008
came
and
we
finally
got
our
first
official
anime
convention
afa
2008
is
actually
the
best
event
since
its
inception
because
they
are
just
starting
up
and
so
they
try
a
lot
of
things
out
without
catering
to
any
crowd
of
people
during
the
event
the
thing
i
liked
the
most
is
that
we
have
a
panel
room
where
we
actually
hosts
japanese
industry
guests
like
koji

and
kunio

of
these

have
been
published
in
three
countries
featuring
130

such
as

clearly
where
ever
when
ever
he

standing

was
a

maybe
i
thought
everybody
where

from
walks
around
all

there
is
a

with

zbigniew
preisner
he
had
worked
with
kieslowski
on
several
films
including
the
three
colors
trilogy
by
the
time
they
did
blue
together
the
two
men
had
a
very
familiar
shorthand
and
knew
what
the
wanted
preisner
recalls
first
working
with
kieslowski
and
talks
about
his
working
methods
thank
you
so
much
for
sticking

i
share

details

those
who

have
convinced
themselves
it
is
the
only
way
to
make
a

as
i
have
said
before
this
is
stockholm
syndrome
the
publishing
industry
does
not
care
about
authors
they
also
are
inept
when
it
comes

making
books

are

still

in

actually
it
s
based

both
the

titel
would
suggest
a
story

referring
to

sounding
similar
to

i

it
s

the

brooklyn
eagle
1841
1955
reported
on
everything
from
international
affairs
politics
and
women's
issues
to
literature
crime
and
real
estate
and
they
did
not
shy
away
from
a
good
ghost
story
either
so
in
honor
of
halloween
we
thought
we'd
share
a
couple
of
the
spine
tinglers
that
were
published
by
the
old
eagle
though
the
newspaper
sometimes
took
the
fun
out
of
it
by
reporting
a
reasonable
explanation
to
the
bumps
in
the
night
they
only
stopped
beating
me
when
i
fell
to
the
ground
even
then
they
continued
to
shout
racial
insults

the
recent
calls
for
a
boycott
of
traditional
closed

scientific
publishers
especially
the
fred

pariah
of
the
moment
elsevier
have
caused
much
discussion
over
the
last
week
in
the
vision
science
community
elsevier
publishes
the
long
running
flagship
journal
vision
research
and
many
of
my
fellow
researchers
are
expressing
frustration
at
providing
free
content
and
peer
review
services
to
a
journal
whose
owner
makes
money
by
restricting
access
to
research
rather
than
disseminating
it
suggestions
made
in
the
past
few
days
have
ranged
from
black
and
white
suggestions
that
we
simply
boycott
all
non
open
journals
to
boycotts
of
specific
publishers
to
more
subtle
discussions
of
the
role
of
copyright
in
this
battle
a
battle
which
is
widely
being
perceived
as
a
tipping
point
in
the
open
access
revolution
the
best
part
about
writing
this
blog
has
been
the
amazing
people
and
pugs
we
have
met
along
the
way
i
mean
it
you
all
have
enriched
our
lives
on
so
many
levels
thanks
for
coming
by
and
reading
and
commenting
thanks
to
those
of
you
who
write
your
own
blogs
i
do
not
want
to
say
i'd
be
nothing
without
you
because
i
am
me
and
i
am
awesome
no
matter
what
however
i
certainly
would
not
be
as
inspired
to
share
my
greatness
without
all
of
you
my
friends

wild
in
the

so
what
movie
am
i
talking
about
that
has
to
do
with
this
and
a
little
princess
which
tells
us
to
be
good
to
others
and
believe
in
our
dreams
and
selves
kamikaze
girls
which
i
admit
i
have
never
watched
eep
or
some
other
feel

happy
g
rated

made
for
a
younger
audience
wrong
i
think
i
have
pretty
much
declared
every
sunday
ben
and
jerry's
ice
cream
day
so
i
will
pick
one
eat
it
and
post
a
review
this
week
i
decided
to
try
the
s'mores
one
it
says
it
is
a
chocolate
ice
cream
with
fudge
chunks
toasted
marshmallow
a
graham
swirl
and
for
once
that
is
actually
what
it
tasted
like
there
was
a
distinct
marshmallow
graham
and
chocolate
taste
the
weird
part
was
some
of
the
graham
swirls
were
liquid
and
some
were
almost
like
cookie
dough
but
that
was
the
great
part
about
it
i
kind
of
wished
there
was
more
graham
cookie
dough
pieces
but
that
also
might
have
ruined
it
when
there
was
it
almost
tasted
salty
not
really
salty
but
almost
like
a
good
sweet
kind
of
salty
even
though
i
miss
the
main
wave
of
addiction
on
tumblr
still
i
am
here
with
a
new

of

so
there
we
were
the
entire
authorblog
clan
dining
out
with
close
friends
at
bertucci's
in
long
island
it
was
late
in
the
evening
we'd
all
had
a
long
day
but
we
reckoned
we
could
all
fit
in
some
pizza
most
of
us
or
pasta
some
of
us
i
wish
i
could
do
that
not
to
be
outdone
three
days
ago
the
london
stock
exchange
group
announced
it
is
in
exclusive
talks
with
lch
clearnet
group
regarding
a
p
a
majority
stake
in
the
london
based
clearing
house
this
give
the
lse
more
downstream
control
of

and
would
also
make
the
lse
a
bigger
competitor
against
the
omnivorous

the
simple
yet
oh

is

it
was
almost
dark
when
we
arrived
at
the
church
the
church
is
not
well
lit
and
only
the
remaining
sunlight
is
our
source
of
light
inside
we
finished
the
prayer
in
less
than
5
minutes
and
commute

if
you
are
now
in
s
presence
then
how
then
can
you
not
be
changed
we
are
just
coming
from
the
easter
season
and
into
a
different
time
but
we
need
to
stay
mindful
of
the
miracles
that
christ
performed
and
be
thankful
daily
for
the
sacrifices
that
he
made
basically
we
need
to
be
just
like
him
and
by
nature
we
need
to
live
every
day
like
it
may
be
our
last
we
need
to
start
living
like
we
were
dying
not
sure
how
to
do
that
well
here
is
a
few
examples
to
chew
on
and
see
how
they
feel
to
you
give
to
a
charity
support
a
child
abroad
go
and
serve
in
the
community
give
without
thinking
and
step
out
of
your
comfort
zone
to
make
a
difference
with
as
many
people
as
you
can
go
do
the
lord
s
bidding
no
matter
what
that
entails
remember
that
his
way
is
perfect
and
yours
is
not
this
is
as
hard
of
a
statement
to
accept
as
any
that
you
will
try
to
pursue
in
your
faith
but
has
made
the
rewards
so
worthy
of
this
challenge
now
as
i
think
about
my
family
and
the
small
contributions
that
we
make
we
do
a
lot
on
that
list
we
would
never
have
done
things
like
we
have
done
in
the
last
year
including
trying
to
support
a
child
overseas
there
was
only
one
thing
that
i
have
not
seen
enough
out
of
us
on
that
list
and
that
would
be
giving
without
thinking
but
some
recent
events
have
transpired
that
is
making
that
a
reality
for
us
and
we
are
happily
moving
foreward
she
goes
over
the
basics
like
telling
the
left
fan
veil
from
the
right
although
i
think
i
have
heard
that
some
bellydancers
dance
with
two
right
handed
fan
veils
and
manage
to
work
them
and
how
to
keep
the
fan
open
whilst
dancing
and
how
to
flick
it
open
or
closed
it
was
definitely
a
team
effort
i
hate
anything
that
involves
math
so
he
measured
and
drew
all
the
squares
for
me
to
make
them
equal
and
he
centered
and
traced
the
razorback
who
knew
to
use
a
car
magnet
finally
i
love
the
curves
of
the
dill
stems
if
you
click
on
the
picture
you
will
see
what
i
am
talking
about
i
do
think
they
provide
and
interesting
look
to
the
picture
the
difficulty
of
the
drills
is
adaptable
to
ensure
a
smooth
and
steady
learning
curve
we
finally
get
to
the

is

there
was
a
fullness
of
life
i
felt
happening
here
one
cold
wet
december
trip
several
years
ago
i
was
visiting
lauren
my
muse
and
oldest
best
friend
who
moved
to
the
city
directly
after
finishing
her
undergrad
at
uva
i
was
a
wide
eyed
girl
from
north
carolina
on
my
first
trip
to
california
a
venture
which
marked
my
second
time
being
west
of
the
mississippi
river
this
morning
as
i
was
getting
ready
to
leave
the
store
one
of
our
greeters
came
in
and
it
was
pretty
obvious
he
was
not
feeling
well
he
was
sweating
heavily
he
was
pale
and
he
was
mumbling
after
talking
to
him
for
a
few
minutes
he
stated
his
chest
hurt
after
a
few
minutes
he
told
us
his
left
arm
hurt
the
prohibitionists
already
have
a
foot
in
the
door
and
minimum
pricing
wedges
it
open
further
it
is
no
means
certain
that
it
will
be
to
the
advantage
of
pub
drinkers
and
pubs
as
mudgie
points
out
camra
as
an
organisation
needs
to
think
again
not
only
is
the
right
savings
product
important
but
also
the
accessibility
of
that
product
often
poor
women
that
live
in
rural
areas
need
to
travel
extremely
far
distances
on
a
regular
basis
many
times
by
foot
to
access
traditional
savings
at
banks
not
only
is
this
inconvenient
and
exhausting
but
involves
time
away
from
their
business
and
thus
a
loss
of
potential
earnings
which
they
often
cannot
afford
if
things
were
not
going
strange
enough
last
night
i
got
hit
with
malware
on
the
computer
i
was
searching
for
some
transmission
drawings
on
the
internet
and
hit
a
site
that
started
trying
to
scan
my
computer
for
errors
trying
to
sell
me
data
recovery
software
and
showed
all
kinds
of
warnings
i
could
not
close
it
out
i
performed
a
virus
scan
and
a
hard
drive
scan
the
scans
made
it
appear
that
all
my
files
were
there
but
i
could
not
find
anything
most
of
the
night
the
scans
ran
but
this
morning
it
was
no
better
after
returning
from
the
dentist
i
had
a
thought
and
ran
a
system
restore
to
a
time
before
the
event
occurred
sure
enough
the
computer
was
restored
to
the
configuration
from
the
previous
day
the
malware
was
gone
and
all
my
files
are
back
the
only
thing
missing
is
my
favorites
on
my
browser
i
need
to
fiqure
out
if
those
can
be
reloaded
i
am
happy
this
worked
i
thought
i
was
going
to
have
to
take
the
computer
somewhere
and
pay
to
get
it
fixed

i
called
my

and
asked
him
to

he

right

we

are
in
the

branding

and
i
would
be
a
liar
if
i
said
it
was
the
easiest
thing
we
have
ever
done
it
is
surprising
how
difficult
the
work
becomes
when
it
is
no
longer
directed
towards
your
clients
and
suddenly
becomes
all
about
you

and
point
have
you
ever
had
to
write
about
yourself
perhaps
a
bio
a

about
me
etc
it
is
more
difficult
than
you
think

puts
it

there
were
lots
of
things
that
prevented

from
progressing

there
would
be

today
who
would
make
it
difficult
for
people
to
get
to
that
point
too
but
not
on
this
day
and
he
goes
on
his
way

which
implies
he
had
a

to
tell

i
had
no

than
a

idea
about

i

do

all
i

was
that
i

that
which

is
related
to
a
mixture
of
regularity
and
irregularity
when
things
are

we
usually
find
them
to
be
uninteresting
because
they
yield
no

for
us
complementary
to
this

things

as
a

that
while
he
has

the

is

and
the

and
it
is
important
to
note
that
this
statement
fully
satisfied
the

that
they
left

set
about

told
me
that
his

carried
that
clock
in
her

from
oklahoma
to
california
during
the

years
it
meant
an
awful

to
her
i

always

hello
you
are

okay
minor
rant
over
bathrooms
are
usually
very
small
especially
in
england
which
means
you
will
almost
always
be
standing
far
too
close
to
the
mirror
this
may
also
be
because
you
are
trying
to
capture
more
detail
shots
that
are
taken
close
up
as
opposed
to
shots
that
are
merely
zoomed
in
often
feel
quite
claustrophobic
to
the
person
looking
at
them
it
is
hard
to
focus
on
certain
parts
of
the
knitting
and
you
naturally
try
to
lean
back
to
remedy
this
which
doesn
t
work
very
few
mirrors

mirrors
most

them
have

which
cause

effects
bits
of

are
stretched
out
and
some
are
squashed
etc
having
the
camera
that
close
to
the
mirror
also
has
the
side
effect
of
making
the
photo
fuzzy
and
out
of
focus

again
will

college

however
it

to

this
our

can
get
involved
to
make
sure
that

can

easier
which
will
save
many
students
time

money
they
can
allow

to

while
still

some

already
do
this
but

should
not

on

consumers
must
decide
what
is

enough
people
become

of

then
those
costs
will
eventually
change

surprised
at
how
we'd
met
most
of
my
initial
goals
despite
having
had
days
weeks
and
even
years
where
i
was
unsure
of
how
well
we'd
done
in
our
homeschool
experiment
and
despite
changing
approaches
several
times
along
the
way
me
on
the
other
hand
did
not
really
care
it
served
its
purpose
it
was
not
like
any
other
robe
it
actually
absorbed
water
it
covered
me
very
nicely
it
has
been
a
good
friend
for
many
years

cwela
said
this
is
my
classic
example
of
what
man
brewers
do
wrong
when
making
a
pale
ale
they
have
the
wrong
flavor
profile
when
brewing
and
it
comes
out
tasting
kinda
soapy
not
that
i
spent
a
good
portion
of
my
childhood
with
a
bar
of
soap
in
my
mouth
being
punished
for
swearing
which
i
was
just
no
soap
or
that
i
have
licked
a
bar
or
soap
or
two
in
the
past
but
it
just
does
not
have
the
most
appealing
taste
its
not
bad
by
any
means
but
if
you
are
going
to
stop
after
one
glass
before
your
you
are
probably
not
going
to
care
for
this
beer

much

what

he
insisted
that
the
economic

in
the
nation
had
left
many
people
with
the

issues
so
those
who
were
victims
of

should
use

it
was

a
palliative
care
doctor
shared
with
us
that
she
often
tells
her
dying
patients
this
don
t
think
of
as
a
hunter
who
s
going
to
shoot
you
when
you
re
least
prepared
rather
think
of
him
as
a
gardener
who
s
picking
the
most
beautiful
flower
in
the
garden
to
bring
home
to
his
loved
ones
always
does
what
s
good
and
as
a
father
he
never
really
wants
to
see
his
children
suffer
it
s
satan
who
s
going
columbine
on
all
of
us
is
what
i
m
saying
in
a
way
it
sounds
a
bit
like
sour
graping
doesn
t
it
because
really
what
would
you
rather
be
a

a

hazen

is
still
growing

crazy
i
feel
like
he
changes
every

he
will
be
3
months
pretty
soon
here
he
smiles
a
ton
and
is
starting
to
giggle
a
bit
he
occasionally
finds
his
thumb
and
we
think
it
is
so
stinkin
cute
it
is
not
that
confusing
just
accept
it
and
stop
trying
to
generate
controversy
out
of
nothing
after
his
appointment
chirkov
said
he
would
prioritize
the
construction
of
navy
fleets
in

the
most
important

for

is
to
build
a

with
the

chirkov
stated
i
call
this
a

but
technically
it
is

i
make
it
all
the

with

sometimes
bulgur

whatever
i
have
at

really
one
more
thing
you
are

wondering
which
one

none
of

lothar
was

what
one
does
not
realize
going
into
a
tome
like
this
is
that
you
can
not
actually
begin
the
cooking
process
for
about
a
week
after
you
purchase
the
book
there
is
a
lot
of
background
on
the
kinds
of
wines
and
butters
and
cookware
you
will
need
before
you
even
begin
then
there
is
a
lot
of
shopping
apple
tv
3
2
tbsp
extra
olive
oil
always
quick
with
a
hug
a
laugh
a
smile
or
a
kind
word
he
gave
selflessly
his
smile
could
brighten
any
day
and
i
always
looked
forward
to
every
family
gathering
to
see
him
and
my
aunt
kay
this
past
saturday
the
sunshine
dimmed
the
clouds
drew
and
the
earth
stopped
turning
for
a
time
as
we
held
our
breath
and
bid
farewell
to
a
favourite
person
in
so
many
of
our
lives
alli
on
the
top
bunk
with
me
kept
whispering
under
her
breath
different
songs
all
the
while
sticking
her
finger
in
my
toes
i
hate
my
feet
touched
there
it
is
oh
this
is
so
wonderful
for
a
woman
who
likes
lots
of
light
in
her
kitchen
one
flip
of
the
switch
and
i
have
it
aunty
you
might
know
this
weird
dude
as
the
lead
singer
of
the
almighty
flute
rocking
70
s
band
jethro
tull
which
rocked
my
other
lead
instrument
than
guitar
seeking
mind
and
universe
besides
being
the
first
artist
to
introduce
the
flute
to
rock
and
still
look
bad
while
soloing
the
outta
that
he
has
always
expressed
a
colorful
eccentric
and
playful
personality
which
obviously
is
heavily
i
may
be
the
last
person
in
texas
to
find
this
out
but
apparently
kids
are
no
longer
being
taught
cursive
in
school
there
are
many
different
forms
of
meditation
a
study
at
massachusetts
general
hospital
examined
the
impact
of
the
buddhist
insight
meditation
on
the
brain
insight
meditation
is
a
technique
of
moving
our
attention
over
the
body
or
focusing
on
our
breathing
the
study
found
that
it
caused
an
increase
in
thickness
of
the
prefrontal
cortex
in
the
brain
the
part
just
above
the
eyes
and
associated
with
attention
the
lord
knows
the
needs
of
his
own
and
lovingly
cares
for
those
needs

may
not
have
been

he
was
assured
that
it
was
the
best
way
for
it
was
s
way
he
could
not
have
worked
out
the
necessary
details
but
could
be
content
that
the

was
taking

of
all
of

i
could
not
get
comfortable
no
the
rules
stipulated
in
the
ten
commandments
lead
to
the
good
life
not
a
so
called
liberation
from
the
commandments
all
people
are
sinful
and
so
all
people
experience
problems
in
their
lives
including
christians
but
those
problems
cannot
be
alleviated
by
throwing
away
s
rules
for
human
living
quite
to
the
contrary
in
fact
biblical
morality
is
a
sure
guide
to
the
good
life
the
happiness
promised
by
the
revolution
is
a
fraud
surely
that
should
be
apparent
by
now
no
rules
no
civilization
the
revolution
left
us
free
to
be
miserable
in
the
harsh
conditions
and
thin
air
they
felt
a
comforting
presence
at
their
side
they
survived

night

this

this

i
ve

people

for

it
is
four
weeks
before
the
strange
couple
are
accepted
in
their
various
peer
groups
even
then
the
association
is
tenuous
and
attributed
to
their
 
ability
 
to
perform
some
needed
task
rather
than
their
scintillating
personalities
anyway
there
s
trouble
in
paradise
because
se
na
sees
that
yi
gak
isn
t
quite
interested
in
her
i
can
understand
her
confusion
given
how
crazy
he
used
to
act
around
her
she
s
sure
park
ha
is
the
source
of
their
problems
but
yi
gak
quickly
comes
to
her
defense
which
in
turn
confirms
things
for
se
na
at
the
cemetery
staniero
comes
to
see
him
to
tell
him
about
the
killings
in
town
francesco
is
a
suspect
but
they
have
already
a
man
who
confessed
to
the
killings
at
the
hospital
after
trying
to
himself
francesco
is
not
happy
that
someone
stole
his
crimes
and
goes
to
the
hospital
he
discovers
it
is
his
friend
franco
from
the
council
francesco
shoots
a
nun
a
doctor
and
a
nurse
dead
while
talking
to
his
friend
when
he
leaves
the
hospital
is
in
chaos
because
there
is
a
madman
killing
people
he
meets
staniero
who
sees
him
with
a
gun
but
still
fails
to
make
the
connection
between
francesco
and
the
killings
i
do
not
really
want
to

an
anonymous
blessing
transfer
into
my
bank
account
that
came
right
on
time
to
the
person
of
the
monarch
anyhow
when
choosing
a
math
curriculum
i
wanted
something
that
would
challenge
my
kiddos
and
provide
them
with
all
of
the
skills
they
needed
to
be
math
geniuses
i
had
heard
great
things
about
math
u
see
but
felt
that
the
boys
had
such
a
different
foundation
that
i
would
not
see
the
success
i
wanted
to
so
i
chose
this
ink
distress
ink
vintage
photo
there
were
two
bikes
that
fit
my
requirements
a
comfy
seat
and
foot
brakes
the
first
one
was
white
and
when
i
took
it
for
a
spin
around
the
aisles
it
felt
too
flimsy
i
was
not
crazy
about
the
white
seat
either
which
would
get
in
the
shop
and
was
not
as
cushy
as
i
hoped
then
i
saw
another
one
way
way
up
on
the
rack
it
looked
way
cooler
it
had
fenders
a
back
thingamajig
to
put
things
on
a
leather
pouch
drink
holder
and
even
a
bottle
opener
on
the
side
of
the
front
wheel
who
could
ask
for
anything
more
although
i
think
bottle
caps
are
no
longer
even
being
made
but
hey
let's
keep
it
vintage
shall
we
that
should
get
the
journalists
 
expert
statisticians
going
she
will
make
her
fortune
if
she
can
do
it
ps
how
do
you
guys
feel
about
me
doing
some
tutorials
where
i
am
talking
into
the
camera
if
you
like
the
idea
what
would
be
helpful
to
know
about
what
are
some
good
subjects
shoe
i
like
very
much
the
story
this
book
is
filled
with
fantasy
romance
mystery
and
a
lot
of
humor
this
is
the
perfect
mix
and
that
s
why
ruby
blue
it
s
perfect
i
like
also
how
the
fantasy
is
mixed
with
the
normality
i
mean
in
one
second
ruby
sees
fairies
and
in
the
next
second
she
kisses
nick
her
boyfriend
the
fantasy
it
s
great
balaced
with
the
teenager
things
and
drama
and
other
stuff
ohter
real
stuff
an
all
time
favourite
i
think
we
ll
be
reading
these
for
years
to
come
what

a

say
because
of
the
no

takes

several

including
the

one
from

darling
i
got
to
go
to
church
here
in
atlanta
this
morning
and
it
was
like
a
slice
of
heaven
the
worship
and
music
were
off
the
charts
and
the
preaching
was
dynamic
i
felt
like
i
could
be
lifted
up
any
second
is
so
good
and
he
is
bringing
me
through
so
much
these
past
few
weeks
fighting
with
pain
is
exhausting
i
feel
guilty
mentioning
it
because
some
of
my
sweet
friends
have
it
much
worse
than
me
at
least
i
can
go
to
work
everyday
and
at
times
i
do
get
some
relief
from
the
pain
wednesday
my
anti
inflammatory
will
be
back
in
stock
and
i
will
be
a
happy
girl
to
get
back
on
my
medicine
it
has
been
back
ordered
for
weeks
and
the
doctor
tried
me
on
another
type
and
i
am
probably
repeating
myself
but
the
indigestion
was
horrible
i
only
took
it
3
days
and
back
to
same
old
same
old
thank
the
lord
he
has
given
people
the
wisdom
to
discover
what
can
help
suffering
there
are
few
things
more
enjoyable
than
watching
bookish
types
acting
catty
so
it
is
with
some
glee
that
i
have
been
following
the
row
that
has
broken
out
between
the
critic
john
sutherland
the
novelist
and
uber

not

don

even
a
decent

i
don

have
a

blogging
is
probably
the
most
technologically
advanced
thing
i
do
all
day
sorry
it
s
been
a
while
don
t
you
hate
when
all
of
your
posts
have
to
contain
apologies
and
it
took
me
years
to
start
a
blog
i
was
the
pitiful
classmate
always
waiting
for
a
tech
savior
during
glitches
in
my
powerpoint
presentation
celebrate
halloween
ring
f21
we
left
the
restaurant
and
headed
out
to
catch
a
bus
back
to
animal
kingdom
from
there
we
got
another
bus
back
to
caribbean
beach
i
of
course
wanted
to
take
a
cab
i
wanted
to
take
a
cab
basically
anytime
we
had
to
take
a
bus
so
you
can
imagine
how
many
times
i
suggested
that
we
take
a
cab
haha
the
original
idea
for
the
afternoon
was
to
surprise
barbara
with
some
water
fun
we
were
going
to
rent
a
pontoon
and
ride
surrey
bike
around
the
resort
the
rain
sort
of
put
a
damper
on
that
and
also
made
us
all
very
tired
barbara
led
us
all
into
making
the
greatest
decision
ever
to
take
a
nap
15
minutes
if
ever
i
do
write
a
story
about
a
funeral
director
i
shall
feel
obligated
i
think
to
call
it
the
impresario
just
like
in
lotto
you
have
to
be
in
it
to
win
the
same
is
true
about
our
careers
you
have
to
be
in
the
game
to
win
you
have
to
know
where
you
are
going
in
order
to
get
there
and
unlike
lotto
your
ultimate
success
is
up
to
you
not
some
random

hear
the
more

think
that
the

while
extremely
necessary
get
on
it
verna
leave
cheryl
miller
alone
can
t
begin
to
scratch
the
surface
of
the
problem
the
story
in
today
s
express
shows
a
young
woman
caught
in
a
vicious
cycle
that
includes
poverty
low
self
esteem
and
bad
life
style
choices
all
around
where
to
start
with
uprooting
the
problem
which
i
feel
must
start
with
a
deterioration
in
family
structures
and
communal
support
systems
very
long
and
balanced
with
elegance
and
structure

years
or
so

last
year
we
started
a
new
thanksgiving
tradition
inspired
by
the
many
variations
of
this
project
i
have
seen
around
the
web
we
made
a
thankfulness
tree
instead
of
just
going
around
the
table
at
thanksgiving
dinner
and
answering
the
proverbial
what
are
you
thankful
for
question
we
spend
the
weeks
leading
up
to
the
holiday
itself
writing
down
our
gratitudes
last
year
i
made
a
huge
paper
tree
that
i
taped
in
the
front
window
and
we
all
wrote
down
what
we
are
thankful
for
on
paper
leaves
and
taped
them
up
too
simple
and
the
end
result
was
quite
lovely
the
fact
that
i
can
find
at
least
one
evening
a
week
to
visit
my
own
blog
and
actually
write
something
the

yours
faithfully
sister
and
i
are
continuing
our
birthday
celebrating
with
a
night
stay
at
this
place
wednesday
night
i
am
jealous
of
myself
i
am
hoping
we
get
a
room
with
a
bath
tub
so
i
can
take
a
bath
after
a
dip
in
the
pool
seriously
i
am
so
excited
i
must
remember
to
call
my
mum
we
have
had
one
year
to
plan
this
wedding
and
i
must
say
it
has
flown
by
i
can
not
wait
to
show
you
her
bridal
portraits
they
are
so
beautiful
after
the
wedding
we
are
renting
cabins
at
a
nearby
lake
with
my
family
to
spend
some
time
together
for
the
rest
of
the
weekend
look
for
those
bridal
photos
the
beginning
of
next
week
one
of
our
contacts
found
us
a
few
things
but
they
said
it
has
been
a
pretty
hard
winter
back
here
so
there
has
not
been
much
opportunity
to
get
out
and
search
beginning
may
10th
this
little
girl
will
be
perched
on
bookshelves
in
stores
throughout
the
uk
and
as
if
she
is
not
sweet
enough
here's
a
really
sweet
deal
to
add
to
the
for
a
limited
time
the
publisher
is
offering
the
e
book
here
for
a
special
promotional

yep
sweet
card
maker
to
a
little
fishing
village
where
there
are
no
phones
while
they
baked
i
showed
her
the
treats
and
told
her
how
delicious
they
would
taste
i
made
a
huge
deal
about
the
whole
event
causing
her
to
wag
her
tail
and
softly
yip
around
the
kitchen
so
have
i
any
criticisms
to
make
well
there
s
lucy
i
have
to
confess
that
i
have
never
been
a
fan
of
miss
ball
even
as
a
youngster
her
tv
shows
irritated
the
out
of
me
now
that
i
m
all
grown
up
i
find
her
even
less
appealing
while
i
watched
this
film
i
found
myself
thinking
that
almost
any
other
actress
would
have
preferable
in
the
role
of
the
resourceful

with
the
arrival
of
the
slightly
colder
weather
we
finally
got
back
into
the
garden
over
the
weekend
paul
is
always
out
in
the
yard
over
the
weekend
mowing
the
lawn
or
weeding
but
this
is
the
first
time
in
months
we
ve
done
any
actual
planting
the
girls
and
i
headed
to
bunnings
on
friday
and
bought
a
whole
bundle
of
flowers
to
add
some
colour
around
the
place
and
with
the
assistance
of
my
gardening
helper
grace
we
managed
to
get
them
all
in
before
a
good
downpour
that
night
on
sunday
we
went
and
got
some
more
flowers
as
well
as
some
seedlings
to
start
off
our
vegetable
patch
again
our
previous
crop
of
vegetables
got
fried
during
the
long
heatwaves

experienced
over

we
are
now
growing

and

that
make

nineteenth

illinois

elizabeth
packard's
troubles
began
when
she
took
public
exception
to
the
rigid
views
of
her
calvinist
minister
husband
theophilus
announcing
that
since
his
wife
persistently
refused
my
will
or
wishes
it
must
be
that
she
is
insane
rev
packard
took
advantage
of
the
illinois
law
that
allowed
a
husband
to
have
a
wife
committed
to
an
insane
asylum
on
his
own
whim
and
the
ever
ready
consent
of
the
admitting
doctor
released
a
few
years
later
through
the
efforts
of
her
son
and
later
found
sane
in
a
sensational
jury
trial
packard
spent
the
rest
of
her
life
lobbying
to
change
the
laws
under
which
she
was
institutionalized

it
might
be
quite

i
have
been

busy

occupied

non

activities
that
have
kept
me
out

i
have
been

this

is
to

of
something
lately
i
have
been
having
a
creative
block

this
was

why
for

felt
wet

i
was
dropping

you
really
should
have

i
just
had
one
for
the
first
time
even
though
that
club's
been
around
for
like
10
years
frig
it
was
fantastic
i
recommend
the
blue
cheese
with
buffalo
sauce
it
is
very
obvious
that
guan
eng
s
remarks
tantamount
to
threatening
the
schools
concerned
it
is
ok
if
you
have
to
be
active
during
the
session
many
people
have
to
work
or
take
care
of
their
families
during
this
time
it
can
still
be
very
beneficial
if
you
are
not
able
to
be
quiet
it
reduces
the
effects
some
but
a
lot
of
energy
can
still
get
in
you
can
also
sleep
during
the
session
this
is
good
way
to
receive
the
energy
because
you
will
be
relaxed

was

we
took

felt

better
than

typically

the
best
thing
i
can
think
of
is
that
secrecy
harris
said
allows
for
frank

open

and
participation
it
also
can
ease

concerns

may

a

everyone

we
are
all
in
our
early

50
 
s
and
our
60

are
looming
ominously
large
when
outsiders
who
have
never
heard
of
s
law
follow
it
more
or
less
by
instinct
they
confirm
its
truth
by
their
obedience
they
show
that
s
law
is
not
something
alien
imposed
on
us
from
without

woven
into
the
very
fabric

our

in
his
essay
the
twelve
men
chesterton
points
out
that
a
distressing
paradox
in
our
world
is
that
the
more
a
man
looks
at
a
thing
the
less
he
can
see
it
in
other
words
the
more
familiarity
we
have
with
something
the
less
likely
we
are
to
appreciate
its
significance
the
posters
and
paintings
that
we
hang
on
our
dorm
wall
soon
become
invisible
to
us
class
material
that
at
first
excites
our

loses
its
appeal

the

drags

members
that
we
love
and
admire
soon
get
taken
for
granted
in
various
ways
our
familiarity
with
the
world
robs
us
of
the
wonder
that
it
initially
instilled
in
us
i'd
never
really
thought
this
way
before
but
i
saw
the
light
on
the
newbury

another
very
famous
socially
responsible
entrepreneur
is
blake
mycoskie
who
when
traveling
in
south
america
met
children
who
did
not
own
shoes
he
started
the
company
toms
a
shoe
company
that
for
every
pair
of
shoes
you
buy
it
donates
a
pair
of
shoes
to
a
child
in
need
he
has
also
expanded
the
program
to
eyeglasses
third
this
particular
undertaking
of
the
sutton
s
task
force
is
cosmetic
and
intended
for
internal
consumption
the
membership
of
the
acna
is
quite
na
ve
in
matters
of
ecumenical
relations
it
is
meant
to
appeal
to
convergentist
sentiments
in
that
body
and
the
convergentist
vision
of
the
acna
as
a
church
in
which
not
only
are
disparate
theological
streams
coming
together
but
also
is
on
the
forefront
of
a
similar
convergence
worldwide
it
also
helps
to
justify
the
existence
of
the
task
force
and
its
funding
ooohh
i
wish
i
was
studying
insects
this
term
for
the
past
2
years
we
have
but
with
the
national
curriculum
we
are
not
learning
about
these
fascinating
creatures
until
maybe
term
3
at
least
i
will
be
ahead
for
then
the
streets
of
london
and
other
areas
of
the
country
have
seen
the
most
appalling
violence
thuggery
and
downright
criminality
in
a
way
that
i
have
never
experienced
in
my
lifetime
these
muffins
are
delicious
and
i
think
they
are
a
great
idea
for
breakfast
on
christmas
morning
on
top
of
that
i
thought
you
deserved
a
simple
recipe
one
that
doesn
t
require
making
custard
soaking
and
processing
dates
or
waiting
for
hours
for
cookies
d
i
have
brewed
another
batch
of
saison
with
yeast
from
the
short's
nicie
spicie
inspired
brew
i
tried
something
i
have
not
done
before
and
fermented
and
dry
hopped
in
the
primary
only
the
result
so
far
is
interesting
not
that
much
additional
hop
aroma
left
the
hops
in
for
about
five
days
but
perhaps
some
additional
hop
flavor
i
expected
less
hop
aroma
that
dry
hopping
in
the
secondary
but
i
was
surprised
by
the
perceived
increase
in
hop
flavor
compared
to
my
hydrometer
sample
that
i
tasted
a
few
days
earlier
i
dry
hopped
with
styrian
goldings
so
the
nose
is
slightly
spicy
the
bittering
and
other
flavoring
hops
were
strisselspalt
chinook
and
amarillo
gold

rest
of
the
recipe

sunny
pre

saturday
i
wanted
her
to
succeed
and
for
weeks
we
struggled
with
no
progress
it
was
stressful
for
everyone
including
other
team
members
whom
i
had
to
rely
on
to
pick
up
the
slack
completely
changing
the
way
you
do
pretty
much
everything
does
not
come
without
its
challenges
i
have
had
to
understand
how
my
body
works
change
things
that
have
been
lifelong
habits
and
work
hard
to
maintain
those
changes
sometime
along
the
way
my
body
started
changing
and
suddenly
some
of
those
challenges
have
shifted
some
disappeared
altogether
some
new
challenges
have
come
up
that
are
altogether
unexpected

with

is
if

the

you

so
what

asked

the

i
have

to

i
find
that
if
i
can
start
talking
about

whether

the

to
me
it
makes

even
if
not
directly
your
work
is
making
a
difference
in
our
lives
and
in
the
steady
progress
of
this
case
in
the
united
states
and
in
the
international
spheres
the
great
red
dragon
is
a
pretty
sweet
sounding
record
with
that
aforementioned
guitar
sound
the
clarity
of
the
drums
and
vocals
and
surprisingly
a
nice
thick
bass
tone
which
anchors
it
all
into
a
darker
foreboding
space
many
bands
spend
whole
careers
concocting
such
a
balance
yet
hellspawn
have
done
it
in
just
two
full
length
records
the
only
caveat
here
is
that
while
i
appreciate
the
band's
infernal
level
of
energy
and
the
fact
that
they
keep
the
tunes
tense
brief
and
incendiary
nothing
ever
feels
quite
that
unique
or
memorable
this
is
a
well
rounded
effort
mind
you
and
few
songs
feel
precisely
the
same
plus
it
has
the
benefit
of
arriving
and
departing
in
under
28
minutes
and
some
well
written
blasphemous
lyrics
but
i
would
not
call
it
infectious
that
said
fans
of
classic
90s
brutality
like
the
earlier
efforts
of
vader
or
hate
or
morbid
angel
circa
covenant
will
likely
find
it

an

it

if

i

t
control
that
end
of

all
i
can
control
is
the
work
itself
and
for
now
that
is
pure
joy
as
christians
through
his
grace
accepts
us
because
we
belong
to
his
precious
son
we
do
not
deserve
his
acceptance
or
his
love
that
he
lavishes
on
us
but
he
graciously
offers
it
to
us

nearly

the

they
were
already
in

and
could
have
done
whatever
they
liked
you
were
spared
heavier

another
outfit
post
from
me
after
a
long
lime
 
cause
my
old

could
not
read
the

these

were
on
that
is
what
happens
when
you
let
your
dad
take
your
pics
you
maybe
will
not
be
seeing
outfit
posts
until
next
week
because
i
was
falling
off
my
bicycle
today
quite
heavily
i
am
wearing
bandages
around
both
hands
right
now
and
my
knee
looks
awful
and
everything
just
because
i
did
not
want
to
be
late
and
did
overtake
a
car
too
near
to
the
pavement
however
it
will
heal
i
ve
been
to
mistletoe
house
it
was
a
friend
s
birthday
today
so
it
was
lovely
to
go
out
for
a
sociable
cup
of
tea
and
piece
of
cake
mistletoe
house
is
a
beautiful
place
to
spend
a
while
it
is
more
than
a
tea
room
it
is
an
art
gallery
and
gift
shop
all
surrounded
by
a
pretty
garden
sadly
the
weather
today
didn
t
allow
us
to
wander
round
the
garden
but
what
a
good

i
am
really
hoping
we
get
all
the
beers
on
tap
everyday
this
here
now
and
gone
till
some
unannounced
time
later
is
highly
annoying
i
have
gone
multiple
days
to
the
same
fest
and
never
got
a
chance
to
taste
some
beers
after
3
days
of
visits
there
is
something
majorly
wrong
with
that
i
understand
supply
and
demand
but
there
needs
to
be
better
communication
to
the
public
maybe
a
board
that
states
when
certain
beers
will
be
on
tap
how
about
using
the
haf
web
site
to
have
a
real
time
list
of
beers
with
a
schedule
of
popular
beer
tap
openings
and
closings

grammys

there
is
a

in

he

done
a

books
at

and
he
reveals
his
secret
is
doing
just
one
thing
at
a
time
after
spending
my
whole
life
treading
water
in
a
sea
of
lunacy
i
found
myself
literally
rolling
on
the
floor
laughing
after
i
heard
mythbuster
adam
savage
say
i
am
also
prepared
for
the
timeworn
technique
online
workshop
with
andy
skinner
starting
next
friday
i
think
i
have
everything
together
i
will
need
fortunately
the
workshop
goes
two
weeks
longer
but
i
have
prepared
some
secrets
to
save
time
and
hopefully
i
can
use
it
o
yes
exactly
just
like
that
i
guess
of
course
i
doubt
anyone
else
will
think
it
is
a
good
idea
another
example
i
can
share
in
january
2010
i
was
watching
the
grammy
awards
it
was
a
pretty
good
show
as
far
as
the
grammy's
are
concerned
but
then
something
spectacular
happened
the
artist
p
nk
came
out
and
gave
one
of
the
most
beautiful
performances
i
have
ever
seen
as
she
sang
her
song
glitter
in
the
air
i
was
moved
moved
enough
to
download
the
song
which
i'd
never
heard
before
over
the
next
few
days
i
listened
to
it
over
and
over
again
east
kent
and
farnham
undoubtedly
have
the
right
soil
and
climate
for
growing
hops
the
farnham
growers
took
more
care
in
their
picking
and
packaging
than
in
other
hop
growing
areas
and
they
were
dried
without
sulphur
here's
the
part
where
this
story
get
sad
so
now
i
have
my
gold
angel
wings
and
i
actually
really
love
how
they
turned
out
i
think
it
is
safe
to
say
this
is
my
last
diy
project
before
the
big
move
i
was
all
excited
to
mount
them
over
our
bed
when
we
decided
we
were
moving
and
would
be
selling
the
house
our
realtor
quickly
neg'd
the
idea
something
about
turning
off
buyers
apparently
not
everyone
shares
my
sentiment
about
sleeping
under
angel
wings
i
want
you
to
help
me
find
me
down
to
my
core
do
it
for
all
of
us
and
above
that
how
about
another
joke
you
do
not

is

remain

way

in

with

this
was
something
i
greatly
enjoyed
as
well
it
was
surprising
to
me
that
this
came
mostly
in
the
arena
of

the
poor
hens
had
moved
back
to
their
coop
but
since
it
was
upside
down
they
were
getting
very
wet
in
the
rain
they
were
obviously
confused
at
the
changes
in

i
could
see
the
black
hen
underneath
the
oldest
son
wanted
to
bury
her
right
away
so
he
went
in
and
tried
to
pull
her
out
soon

s
alive
sure

that

bird
lived
through

the

sun
rose
high
into
the
sky
we
looked
up
on
it
and
even
as
we
depended
on
the
glowing
orb
for
our
lives
we
found
it
strange
and
foreign
it
was
warming
but
the
heat
we
longed
for
never
came
somehow
it
lingered
just
out
of
reach
as
the
sun
crossed
the
sky
we
followed
it
down
the
beach
until
the
coast
shifted
and
the
ocean
crossed
our
path
the
distance
was
too
far
and
the
sun
was

may
you
all
have

we

had

it
ain't
that
is
for

but
there
is
a
part

that
is

choosing
that
banana
the
cookies
yes
ies
ya
 
really
think
i'd
only
eat
one
would
have
satisfied
for
the
period
of
time
it
would
have
taken
to
put
them
into
my
mouth
chew
them
up
and
swallow
them
then
the
guilt
would
set
in
almost
immediately
what
have
i
done
i
just
compromised
all
that
work
i
did
yesterday
i
am
such
a

if
you
do
not

anything
about

it

that
basically
shows

the
unethical

disgusting
practices
that
goes
into

in

it
is

was

this

for
how

now
that
christmas
is
only
a
few
days
away
and
there
is
no
possible
way
i
could
expect
to
get
any
of
these
for
christmas
unless
santa
listens
to
old
folk
i
will
post
my
gift
guide
i
will
admit
that
i
am
only
human
and
while
i
try
to
show
those
around
me
that
i
somehow
 
 
have
it
all
together
 
 
the
reality
is
that
i
do
not
and
i
have
been
going
through
a
hard
battle
on
my
own
since
november
divorce
is
it
is
hard
it
is
frustrating
it
is
embarrassing
it
is
lonely
it
breaks
you
down
bit
by
bit
and
at
first
everything
seems
so
much
easier
but
in
my
experience
once
the
novelty
wears
off
it
can
be
one
of
the
most
difficult
things
a
person
goes
through
sometimes
i
wish
i
could
curl
up
in
a
cocoon
for
several
months
and
then
magically
wake
up
and
all
of
these
tough
emotions
would
be
worked
out
on
their
own
but
life
does
not
have
a
fast
forward
button
or
even
a
pause
button
i
have
already
learned
so
much
about
myself
and
those
around
me
from
this
experience
and
i
have
a
feeling
that
the
lessons
will
never
cease
to
show
themselves
my
title
was
executive
assistant
but
it
was
one
of
the
most
diverse
jobs
i
ve
ever
had
the
experience
and
skills
i
learned
have
helped
me
with
many
other
opportunities
since
then
download
everything
pro
is
a
very
lite
yet
super
powerful
downloading
utility
that
will
let
you
search
and
download
all
the
indexed

and

all

i
like
that

of

in
my
mouth
bad
for
teeth
but
like
the
bubbles
over
the
last
month
it
s
become
increasingly
clear
that
there
is
a
coordinated
information
operations
campaign
in
place
to
downplay
the
impact
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
oil
spill
the
us
government
and
british
petroleum
have
imposed
a
scientific
and
media
blackout
to
prevent
the
gathering
of
the
information
on
the
oil
leak
needed
to
generate
precise
estimates
to
do
the
work
of
we
simply
need
to

he
pushed
his
sloppy
fingers
into
her
mouth
as
he
plunged
his
raging
inside
her
and
she
let
out
a
choking
scream
as
she
came
again
shuddering
against
him
the
strange
tightness
of
his
in
her
and
the
plug
in
her
was
astonishing
the
lower
half
of
her
face
was
covered
in
her
own
juice
and
his
rude
squeezing
fingers
and
he
lowered
his
head
and
bit
the
plump
top
of
her
left
and
growled
into
her
skin
thrusting
and
biting
and
moaning
low
and
deep
he
filled
her
with
hot
bursts
of
his
thick
cream
she
clutched
at
his
thick
hard
arms
and
rolled
on
wave
after
wave
of
a
pleasure
so
hard
it
was
painful

this
got
me
thinking
could
the

mechanical
structure
be
applied
to
a
different
purpose
in
this
case

she
got
right
paparazzi

on

to
catch
khloe's

and
the

blogs
ripped
her
to
shreds
let
this
be
a
lesson
kids
always
do
a
full
length
mirror
check
before
you
leave
home
and
buy
clothes
to
fit
the
body
you
have
not
the
one
you
think
you
have
even
the
cps
could
not
find
a
way
to
ignore
that
although
they
certainly
tried
and
the
media
have
been
busily
burying
all
memory
of
the
case
ever
since
i
have
been
making
this
for
just
over
4
years
now
and
it
is
been
a
hit
every
single
time
even
the
omnivores
end
up
having
seconds
personally
i
think
that
one
of
the
keys
to
success
with
this
is
to
have
a
really
delicious
gravy
with
it
my
favorite
for
the
past
couple
of
years
is
the
punk
rock
chickpea
gravy
from
vegan
with
a
vengeance
if
you
do
not
want
to
bother
with
making
your
own
gravy
the
simply
organic
mushroom
sauce
packets
are
quite
good
you
will
just
want
to
make
sure
to
buy
3
4
packets
so
you
have
enough
for
the
entire
roast
i
will
put
up
a

we
did
have
a
bit
of
drama
when
we
first
arrived
the
realtor
had
given
us
the
code
to
the
house's
lockbox
which
tom
punched
in
it
did
not
work
thinking
the
internal
mechanism
might
be
frozen
he
punched
the
numbers
in
harder
again
and
again
but
the
box
still
would
not
open
watching
this
from
the
warm
van
the
kids
and
i
became
mildly
panicked
and
began
calling
on
every
saint
in
heaven
for
assistance
tom
got
back
into
the
van
called
our
realtor
and
got
a
recording
that
her
number
had
been
disconnected
for
over
two
centuries
it
published

appellation
came
to
my
attention
this
year
and
is
my
main
shop
as
its
on
my
way
home
from
work
and
i
manage
to
pick
up
a

beer
nearly
every
visit
and
just
in
the

few
months
royal

opens
a
cracking
new
shop
up

and
an
ex

employee
has
just
opened
the

down
cannonmills
way
while
vinowines
has
just
opened
a
new
store
in

the
effects
are
pure
corman
kitsch
for
the
early
sixties
there
are
some
interesting
visuals
thanks
to
john
howard
and
an
effect
called
spectarama
where
things
are
seen
through
xavier's
eyes
as
clothing
skin
membrane
musculature
skeletons
building
walls
and
the
very
fabric
of
the
universe
gets
peeled
away
before
our
own
eyes
and
while
the
effects
succeed
in
giving
us
visions
that
we
have
never
seen
for
cheap
presumably
they
also
make
us
realize
that
a
movie
like
x
the
man
with

is
about
more
than
the

in

we

however
it

for

and
as

declares
nobody
is
going
to
be
preachy
we
just
want
people
to
know
that
if
they
ever
have
a
problem
there
will
be
somebody
there
who
has
been
through
it
before
who
can
help
c
holiday
help
these
cookies
were
delicious
melt
in
your
mouth
and
so
buttery
the
full
recipe
called
for
a
full
pound
of
butter
and
that
scared
the
bujeesus
out
of
me
so
i
cut
the
recipe
in
half
the
halved
recipe
below
still
made
a
substantial
amount
of
cookies
but
if
you
want
need
more
then
just
double
it
the
fun
thing
about
this
cookie
is
that
you
can
roll
the
chilled
dough
in
non
pareils
or
colored
sugar
and
coordinate
with
any
holiday
or
celebration
that
you
need
i
used
blue
sprinkles
for
half
of
the
dough
and
rolled
the
other
half
in
raw
sugar
it
is
not
necessary
but
it
adds
a
nice
textural
element
to
the
tender
cookie
and
it
makes
them
extra
pretty
the
dough
can
be
made
ahead
of
time
then
when
you
are
ready
for
them
just
slice
and
bake
and
now
the
jar
is
empty
i
ve
never
seen
forrest
gump
i
ve
also
never
seen
the
wizard
of
oz
how
i
ve
made
all
these
years
i
ll
never
know
but
evening
s
empire
reminds
me
of
what
i
know
about
it
through
cultural
osmosis
this
is
as
bono
puts
it
in
a
blurb
on
the
back
of
the
novel
an
alternative
history
of
the
sixties
generation
while
flanagan
shies
away
from
showing
us
the
ravons
interacting
with
other
great
british
rock
and
roll
bands
for
instance
bowie
is
only
mentioned
in
passing
as
a
starstruck
youth
in
a
british
club
the
ravons
through
three
very
different
careers
manage
to
hit
almost
every
large
event
in
rock
and
roll
history
except
live
aid
which
haunts
emerson
to
this
day
while
a
lot
of
it
just
makes
sense
for
a
lesser
known
contemporary
of
the
beatles
i
thought
the
ravons
success
with
technology
was
stretching
it
a
bit
whenever
the
recording
industry
switches
to
a
new
format
the
former
ravons
manage
to
always
get
out
ahead
but
for
the
most
part
flanagan
creates
a
very
believable
journey
through
the
sixties
to
the
aughts
with
each
decade
retaining
a
distinctive
but
not
stereotypical
flavor
chocolate
malt
i
took
this
photo
with
lighting
from
my
lamp
so
please
excuse
the
poor
lighting
and
grainy
quality
personally
i
prefer
the
versatility
of
separate
diapers
and
covers
for
the
same
reason
i
prefer
tops
and
skirt
to
dresses
not
only
does
it
allow
me
to
experiment
more
with
what
i
have
maybe
the
cover
is
fine
but
i
do
not
like
my
liner
or
cloth
diaper
but
i
can
also
replace
just
one
part
of
the
diaper
system
when
it
wears
out
rather
than
the
whole
thing
cover
wears
out
i
still
have
the
cloth
diaper
inner
diaper
elastic
wears
out
i
can
easily
make
a
new
diaper

this

certainly
not
our
invasion
and
their
defense
when
facing
the
armies
of
the
united
states
and
the
soviet
union
in
world
war
ii
did
the
germans
have
the
moral
right
to
self
defense
because
those
armies
invaded
their
country
the
entire
invasion
of
the
allies
into
germany
was
self
defense
against
germany
to
claim
that
in
gaza
they
are
defending
themselves
against
our
invasion
is
really
a
not
serious
objection

the

have
to
ask
what

up
if
you
listen
to

of
the

story
part
of
it
had
to
with
rising

but
a

i
visited
gettysburg
in
september
2010
with
my
fiance
tony
i
walked
alone
out
into
the
wide
open
pasture
which
was
once
the
wheat
field
i
felt
the
thick
dark
energy
that
permiated
the
air
crushing
my
chest
with
its
heavy
weight
the
silence
screamed
at
me
and
i
could
almost
hear
the
hot
breath
of
wild
eyed
horses
and
charging
foot
soldiers
all
around
me
i
did
not
feel
alone
in
the
least
changito
is
colored
with
pencils
and
accented
with
a
black
gel
pen
and
a
touch
of
glitter
i
used
my
corner
rounder
to
add
a
bit
of
interest
to
the
panels
i
really
need
to
remember
to
do
this
more
often
i
finished
the
card
with
some
white
brads
only
after
i'd
finished
did
i
realize
that
i
put
the
rain
drop
panel
on
upside
down

is

100
pages

somewhat
improbable

and
hopefully
be

at

the

as

will
be
if
i
allow
anyone
to
tear
me
down
o
you
my
life
smells
like
a
warm
dark
bread
to
finish
off
we
had
a
roasted
rice
ball
with
cod
roe
inside
this
was
also
really
excellent
the
big
plump
grains
of
pearl
rice
round
the
outside
a
nice
golden
colour
and
deliciously
cirspy
while
the
rice
around
the
roe
stayed
soft
and
perfectly
cooked
he
disappeared
into
the
bathroom
i
stood
up
and
went
to
the
window
i
pulled
back
the
curtain
the
city
stared
back
all
million
eyes
or
so
it
felt
the
lights
were
just
amazing
wait
what
i
m
in
a
cage
again
they
re
both
gone
are
they
coming
back
are
they
abandoning
me
what
will
i
eat
after
i
finish
the
gooey
stuff
in
this
kong
actually
why
don
t
i
just
eat
that
now
it
smells
great
and
maybe
some
food
will
soothe
my
nerves
well
jemma
lost
her
second
tooth
today
she
was
eating
cheese
its
in
the
car
on
the
way
to
the
doctor
pink
eye
and
said
mommy
i
do
not
feel
my
wiggly
tooth
i
looked
back
and
sure
enough
there
was
no
tooth
she
said
where
is
it
i
replied
i
bet
you
swallowed
it
then
we
both
cracked
up
she
thought
this
was
pretty
funny
and
assured
me
we
could
just
write
a
note
to
the
the
tooth
fairy
oh
my
sweet
baby
wordpress
com
blogs
that
i
follow
the
great
thing
about
this
project
is
that
you
probably
already
have
everything
on
hand
i
dug
through
my
fabric
stash
and
grabbed
any
pink
or
red
fabric
that
i
could
find
what
makes
this
even
more
special
is
that
some
of
the
fabric
i
used
is
from
lily's
great
grandmother
that
said
there
are
a
lot
of
physical
places
i
knew
growing
up
here
as
a
child
that
no
longer
exist
the
loss
of
some
make
me
sad
and
make
san
francisco
a
significantly
poorer
place
in
my
opinion
we
re
not
in
the
great
scheme
of
things
a
very
old
place
we
don
t
have
bottomless
stores
of
architectural
beauty
and
history
we
should
appreciate
and
preserve
the
important
things
we
have
and
this
is
one
of
those
great
craigslist
stories
where
its
even
better
in
person
the
color
was
off
in
the
pics
on
the
ad
but
when
i
got
there
my
dreams
were
confirmed
it
was
that
sick
sweet
soft
mint
green
in
pristine
condition
plus
it
came
with
a
faucet
that
was
not
mentioned
in
the
ad
the
faucet's
a
repro
but
still
good
areas
have
been
deforested
for
agriculture
and
then
abandoned
once
the
soils
have
lost
their
fertility
what
many
do
not
realise
is
the
fertility
of
a
rich
forest
is
mostly
captured
in
its
vegetation
only
through
the
continuous
cycle
of
life
and
death
are
nutrients
released
into
the
ecosystem
once
you
the
vegatation
away
the
soils
hold
only
a
small
volume
of
the
nutrients
they
then
become
increasingly
impoverished
as
they
are
over
farmed
and
as
rain
washes
away
the
remaining
but
unbound
fertile
topsoils
the
project
estimated
to
have
a
reclamation
cost
of
between
rm3
2bil
and
rm3
5bil
and
a
gross
development
value
of
rm9bil
to
rm10bil
could
do
with
the
financial
muscle
of
a
company
like
sime
darby
i
offered
to
take
my
niece
out
for
the
morning
as
they
were
babysitting
her
but
desperately
wanted
to
carry
on
sorting
out
the
books
they
had
got
the
day
before
after
much
deliberation
we
decided
we
d
try
somewhere
she
d
been
before
and
enjoyed
and
as
an
added
bonus
somewhere
i
d
enjoy
going
to
as
well
as
it
was
a
wee
bit
nippy
the
park
was
out
so
we
went
to
the
deep
in
hull
this
place
has
some
good
memories
for
me
and
now
has
traumatic
childhood
memories
for
my
niece
mwahahah
so
far
we
have
to
be
fair
this
semester
has
been
good
to
me
well
i
have
junioritis
real
bad
so
my
grades
probably
so
other
than
my
grades
and
this
emotional
hurricane
i
ve
been
dealing
with
life
is
good
i
started
playing
bass
at
the
vineyard
i
finally
joined
a
small
group
and
have
been
somewhat
regularly
doing
my
quiet
times
i
ve
spent
a
lot
of
time
with
old
friends
while
making
some
new
ones
along
the
way
it
s
good
to
be
twenty
one
and
somewhere
in
there
i
found
time
to
ride
800
some
miles
good
morning
all
it
will
probably
be
afternoon
by
the
time
i
post
this
since
i
have
yet
to
take
pictures
but
i
ll
pretend
it
s
still
morning
i
like
this
outfit
and
i
hope
you
do
too
i
ve
had
this
dress
forever
it
was
a
hand
me
down
from
my
sister
i
think
the
first
time
i
wore
it
was
four
years
ago
since
it
s
extremely
short
i
thought
i
should
wear
it
with
extra
thick
tights
since
you
know
it
s
still
winter
the
dark
purple
tights
bring
out
the
light
purple
in
the
dress
and
i
like
the
contrast
between
the
dark
purple
and
the
red
stripe
my
everyday
boots
and
denim
shirt
keep
it
casual
as
much
as
i
love
designer
clothing
you
don
t
need
a
label
to
look
good
but
i
loved
it
adored
it
fiercely
thanks
to
the
mad
men
show
story
line
where
don
draper's
ex
wife
betty
got
fat
from
a
thyroid
problem
there
is
now
a
fatbettyfrancis
twitter
account
and
some
of
the
tweets
are
pretty
funny
also
i
took
this
picture
from
a
fatbettyfrancis
tumblr
site
k
thx
bye
taxes
and
also
not
raise
taxes
this
is
one
of
those
movies
that
i
had
been
longing
to
see
for
months
before
i
ever
got
the
chance
to
view
it
the
title
grabbed
my
attention
immediately
and
that
along
with
the
premise
and
the
fact
that
it
stars
sandra
dee
made
me
almost
certain
that
it
would
be
amazing
usually
when
a
movie
has
so
much
going
for
it
the
expectations
are
lived
up
to
unfortunately
as
you
will
remember
from
last
sunday
this
is
not
always
the
case
but
doctor
you
have
got
to
be
kidding
does
not
disappoint
if
like
me
you
always
have
tons
of
great
gift
ideas
throughout
the
year
and
then
promptly
forget
every
one
of
these
great
ideas
in
the
run
up
to
christmas
then
i
am
hoping
that
my
little
gift
guides
might
be
able
to
help
so
keep
your
eyes
above
for
the
ever
changing
fun
and
um
i
realize
that
is
not
the
best
camera
angle
for
my
hand
dude
it
looks
huge
so
i
apologize
for
that
and
our
clunky
keyboard
has
a
plastic
y
sound
that
i
hate
if
you
have
an
unwanted
piano
feel
free
to
send
it
to
me
if
she
ever
has
a
spotted
lamb
then
i
will
know
she
has
the
spotting
gene
if
she
does
carry
the
spotting
gene
there
is
only
a
1
in
4
chance
she
will
have
a
spotted
lamb
we
really
believe
in
balance
in
our
beers
at
boulevard
and
deschutes
nails
it
with
bachelor
i
find
this
beer
amazingly
drinkable
and
refreshing
my
best
friend
lives
in
eugene
oregon
and
i
pound
this
beer
whenever
i
go
out
to
visit
i
have
fond
memories
of
standing
waist
deep
in
a
lake
drinking
this
beer
larry
sidor
brewmaster
of
deschutes
was
kind
enough
to
hook
me
up
with
a
case
of
it
when
i
visited
his
brewery
a
little
different
twist
on
jesus
golden
rule
which
appears
by
the
way
in
some
form
in
virtually
every
spiritual
tradition
i
turned
the
words
around
however
because
i
ve
learned
that
you
only
ever
do
to
others
what
you
do
to
yourself
and
conversely
you
do
to
yourself
what
you
do
to
others
i
think
it
was
the
buddhist
pema
chodron
who
first
taught
me
this
so
i
can
t
help
but
wonder
when
a
nation
like
the
u
s
goes
to
war
and
kills
others
there
s
perhaps
a
sense
in
which
we
something
within
ourselves
in
the
process
which
is
probably
why
the
chinese
say
before
seeking
vengeance
better
dig
two
graves
now
my
compassion
slowly
drowns
after
lunch
and
a
much
needed
caffeine
pick
me
up
we
were
off
to
pick
out
our
new
tree
as
soon
as
we
got
to
our
local
store
and
hit
the
nursery
boog
spotted
the
loveliest
lilies
i
love
lilies
so
of
course
they
were
immediately
added
to
our
shopping
cart
soon
we
came
upon
a
hibiscus
plant
when
littles
saw
it
she
started
to
grab
for
it
and
say
my
my
over
and
over
again
until
i
put
it
in
our
cart
so
littles
picked
out
our
tree
i
think
it
is
really
a
bush
and
boog
picked
out
some
flowers
to
add
to
our
yard
i
hope
through
my
practices
to
honor
the
women
children
and
men
who
have
lost
their
lives
and
who
are
struggling
to
survive
now
said
nancy
a
resident
of
roswell
ga
my
daily
journey
will
be
much
easier
than
theirs
but
i
live
in
a
society
where
people
die
from
obesity
and
obesity
related
issues
we
die
from
too
much
they
die
from
not
enough
there
are
thing
going
on
right
now
that
are
bigger
than
us
look
at
the
big
picture
people
he
saw
the
dark
grassland
he
saw
the
baobab
tree
in
the
corner
standing
tall
like
some
genie
from
the
arabian
nights
suddenly
he
saw
something
moving
to
his
right
he
was
stunned
in
fear
and
shock
the
very
next
second
them
looks
up
thank
you
while
the
famiy
loves
and
appreciates
the
visitors
it
is
best
that
marissa
not
be
in
large
crowds
of
people
with
tons
of
questions
etc
she
just
needs
to
take
it

and
one
day
at
a
time

our

and
the
first
coat
of

birch
white
by
dunn
edwards
went
up
while
it
is
not
as
white
as
i
wanted
it
to
be
i
think
it
looks
pretty
good
and
the
warmth
of
the
white
keeps
the
house
from
looking
like
a
sterile
hospital
it
is
finally
fall
here
in
the

it
rained
yesterday
which
sent
me
into
a
fall
baking
tizzy
on

of

cleaning
in
between
all
of
that
i
was
able
to
squeeze
a
quick
card
in
for

in
a
country
of
immigrants
some
who
arrived
earlier
than
others
none
of
these
traditional
practices
should
really
sound
strange

foreign
to
americans
kolker
throws
in
some
numbers
to
assure
us
that
there
are
fewer
foreign
borns
in
the
country
today
when
compared
to
a
hundred
years
ago
many
of
the
immigrants
who
entered
the
new
world
a
century
ago
surely
had
their
own
version
of
these
practices
somehow
in
the
intervening
years
they
have
been
displaced
by
modern
american
values
i
certainly
don
t
wish
to
idealize
either
the
traditions
or
their
modern
counterparts
but
it
is
fascinating
to
note
the
rate
at
which
cultures
and
people
change
or
stay
the
same
while
immigrant
pockets
might
still
be
practicing
assisted
marriages
their
peers
in
origin
countries
might
consider
the
practice
as
antiquated
as
contemporary
americans
do
from

we

a
specific
pace
was
specified
for
each
of
the
runs
they
were
generally
at
the
marathon
pace
10
24
minutes
mile
plus
30
45
seconds
per
mile
for
the
first
9
weeks
i
completely
ignored
the
paces
i
just
ran
whatever
felt
comfortable
which
was
usually
around
9
50
minute
miles
at
the
start
of
each
run
my
sunday
runs
were
nearly
always
followed
by
sunday
rehearsal
so
i
felt
pressure
to
get
the
run
over
with
as
quickly
as
possible
in
order
to
move
on
to
the
next
agenda
item
running
too
fast
may
have
contributed
to
my
failure
to
complete
some
of
the
early
long
runs
shortly
after
the
heart
mini
i
started
following
the
prescribed
slower
paces
for
the
rest
of
my
runs
and
for
the
most
part
completed
the
distances
well
never
mind
that
everybody
and
their
grandmother
is
on
pinterest
now
i
am
serious
i
know
grandmothers
on
pinterest
but
pinning
has
become
as
much
of
a
household
word
as
facebooking
someone
or
googling
something
aaaand
apparently
the
selective
period
is
over
since
i
recently
got
a
shitload
of
hate
comments
on
one
of
my
pins
seriously
who
does
that
pinterest
began
as
such
a
grown
up
place
to
get
ideas
on
pimping
your
house
and
making
your
own

up
from

and
all
of

sudden
people
look
at
a

pic
of
a

not
me
who
lost
weight
and
got
ridic
in
shape
and
are
like
sorry
i
do
not
think
that
is
possible
wha
i
just
wanted
to
pin
it
for
inspiration
now
i
have
35
comments
of
people
basically
arguing
whether
it
is
possible
or
not
and
400something

all
of
which
were

made

by
cutting
a
6
length
of
ribbon
and
folding
then
and
adhering
each
fold
with
a
sticky
dot
i
love
ribbon
loops
they
just
add
a
sweet
feminine
touch
it
was
a
female
fox
i
am
betting
she
was
out
hunting
to
feed
her
kits
then
the
branches
are
felt
which
i
brushed
with
a
little
bronze
ink
and
the
flowers
are
some
layered
primas
finally
i
added
a
small
journal
tag
and
that
is
all
there
is
to
it
fast
forward
to
this
morning
the
phone
call
i
was
scared
to
answer
it
for
fear
he
was
going
to
tell
me
my
mom
had
died
thankfully
that
is
not
what
he
said
but
i
am
worried
today
as
her
heart
rate
and
blood
pressure
are
up
he
said
she
was
in
afib
again
i
thought
the
drs
had
found
something
that
was
going
to
control
it
but
i
guess
it
is
not
working
so
well
the
afib
scares
me
because
that
is
what
caused
the
strokes
but
if
her
heart
does
not
slow
down
it
keeps
going
up
it
could
herniate
and
ultimately
her
but
too
expensive
to
jump
on
a
plane
tomorrow
my
mother
has
always
been
a
fan
of
my
scrapbooking
always
wanting
to
see
my
latest
projects
and
buying
all
the
magazines
that
i
get
published
in
this
women
rocks
now
it
is
time
to
honor
her
and
what
better
way
than
to
have
her
beautiful
face
on
the
gcd
studios
blog
i
love
making
my
momma
proud
and
thou
shalt
see

contented

fenn
young
neo
pro
new

apparently
he
s
quite
a
prospect
i
ve
not
seen
anything
from
him
yet
so
i
look
forward
to
finding
out
what
he
can
do
this
is
one
aspect
to
think
about
maria
menounos
after
making
fun
of
another
minty
green
gown
earlier
in
this
review
i
have
to
laugh
a
bit
that
this
one
is
on
my
best
dressed
the
vibe
is
completely
differing
it
is
green
chiffon
layered
over
a
shimmering
gold
fabric
and
it
the
cut
of
the
gown
makes
her
look
like
a
greek
goddess
loved
this
gown
ellie
kemper
in
armani
prive
i
loved
this
gown
i
have
to
admit
i
wanted
to
smack
ellie
for
referring
to
it
as
a
 
rust
 
color
rust
is
copper
is
pretty
i
am
surprised
that
the
color
goes
so
well
with
her
red
hair
but
this
was
a
definite
hit
for
me
and
moving
on
to
our
first
nominee
for
best
dressed
jennifer
lopez
 
daring
and
revealing
zuhair
murad
gown
was
gorgeous
and
hugged
her
curves
in
all
the
right
places
as
to
the
alleged
wardrobe
malfunction
i
do
not
believe
for
a
second
that
it
happened
with
a
plunging
neckline
that
she
was
probably
glued
into
that
dress
to
make
sure
that
everything
stayed
where
it
was
supposed
it
george
clooney
must
have
known
he
was
not
taking
home
the
statue
but
it
was
okay
because
his
girlfriend
stacy
keibler's
was
oscar
personified
in
her
marchesa
dress
i
usually
hate
the
gold
dress
like
oscar
gowns
but
this
one
is
just
so
flattering
and
hugs
her
in
all
the
right
places
i
was
highly
amused
by
the
e
commentary
when
one
of
the
stylists
gasped
and
realized
where
the
 
missing
 
gold
marchesa
gown
she'd
wanted
for
one
of
her
clients
was
it
is
good
to
be
clooney's
girlfriend
emma
stone
in
giambattista
valli
i
love
this
gown
she
looked
so
statuesque
i
loved
the
bow
i
loved
the
slip
from
neck
to
navel
that
was
only
visible
once
she
began
presenting
the
belted
waist
and
and
i
love
how
the
raspberry
fabric
flowed
around
her
there
is
been
a
lot
of
criticism
regarding
her
selection
saying
she
wore
the
same
dress
as
nicole
kidman
wore
in
2007
folks
they
each
were
a
shade
of
red
and
had
a
bow
the
comparison
stops
there
she
looks
gorgeous
and
she
is
high
on
my
best
dressed
list
rose
byrne
in
vivienne
westwood
va
va
va
voom
westwood
is
admittedly
one
of
my
favorite
designers
but
wow
the
gown
which
is
apparently
midnight
blue
not
black
shimmers
fits
her
like
a
slim
column
and
has
an
amazing
one
shoulder
strap
the
platform
peep
toe
shoes
the
long
silver
earrings
and
the
severe
bob
cut
just
makes
this
outfit
sophisticated
perfection
i
want
to
be
her
gwyneth
paltrow
in
tom
ford
she
looks
like
a
million
dollars
and
is
officially
my
hero
if
she
succeeds
in
helping
the
cape
to
make
a
comeback
the
elegant
and
simple
lines
of
the
gown
and
cape
are
just
perfect
and
i
was
amazed
at
how
well
the
one
shoulder
look
works
with
the
cape
the
award
for
best
dressed
goes
to
jessica
chastain
in
her
larger
than
life
mcqueen
gown
the
gold
embroidery
and
beading
on
black
is
just
stunning
and
it
had
a
gorgeous
train
the
colors
worked
very
well
with
her
red
hair
before
i
knew
it
was
a
mcqueen
gown
i
was
immediately
reminded
of
his
iconic
peacock
dress
just
like
every
girl
dreams
of
her
wedding
dress
i
think
if
you
grow
up
dreaming
of
going
to
the
oscars
this
is
the
kind
of
dress
you
dream
of
and
it
is
the
kind
of

you
wear

if

the

as

essentially
then
we
have
to
simply
rely
on
the
fact
that
it
is
a

for
the

it

okay
so
what
have

been
up

i
never

in

we
talked
about

i

this
is
what
we
plan
on

on

check
it
out
i
am
one
of

wanted
once
the
sun
goes
down

tell
the

of

the

the

their

reads
shutter
island
has
the
extra
problem
of
being
a
product
of
its
time
where
the
construction
of
the
plot
is
more
important
than
the
sum
of
its
themes
it
becomes
a
series
of
parlor
tricks
that
leads
to
a
conclusion
that
is
not
as
mind
blowing
as
the
director
or
writer
hoped
it
feels
like
someone
telling
you
they
will
pull
a
table
cloth
off
without
pulling
off
the
dishes
they
tug
at
the
cloth
just
a
little
and
then
say
they
are
going
to
do
it
for
real
this
time
they
then
repeat
this
several
more
times
before
flipping
the
entire
table
with
the
dishes
crashing
to
the
floor
those
dishes
are
the
big
twist
and
another
tonight
my
children
who
go
to
bed
relatively
easily
on
most
nights
probably
because
our
summertime
schedule
is
exhausting
had
issues
tonight
mark
wondered
if
he
could
stay
up
and
keep
me
company
the
answer
is
no
mommy
is
very
tired
and
wants
to
relax
and
be
alone
translated
into
no
mommy
is
very
tired
and
wants
to
watch
the
real
housewives
of
new
jersey
that
she
has
recorded
since
daddy
is
way
above
such
trivial
nonsensical
television
viewing
zachary's
comforter
was
in
mark's
room
downstairs
so
i
tried
to
pull
off
a
switch
a
roo
and
put
a
crocheted
blanket
his
auntie
sarah
had
given
him
when
he
was
born
to
cover
him
he
was
not
amused
and
cried
but
mommy
it
has
holes
in
it
so
i
threw
a
sheet
on
him
and
said
i'd
bring
up
his
comforter
ben
he
sobbed
because
i
want
a
sheet
that
is
not
cut
do
you
want
to
venture
a
guess
into
why
his
sheet
might
be
cut
because
he
cut
it
with
scissors
and
yet
it
warranted
huge
tears
and
breathless
sobbing
make
a
note
that
eric
had
no
issues
other
than
requesting
an
extra
hug
he
is
so
so
big
and
wonderful
anyways
i
m
not
sure
who
is
into
all
this
scary
horror
stuff
but
it
obviously
sells
or
they
wouldn
t
be
producing
so
many
horror
movies
each
year
just
the
covers
of
some
of
these
movies
is
plenty
enough
to
creep
me
out
place
the
pizza
stone
baking
sheet
inside
oven
and
cook
for
about
10
minutes
or
until
the
egg
looks
cooked
i
needed
to
cook
mine
a
little
longer
about
5
minutes
longer
but
your
oven
may
differ
just
keep
checking
after
10
mins
you
ll
know
when
it
s
done
third
eat
6small
meals
instead
of
3large
meals
your
metabolism
will
not
suffer
from
peaks
and
lows
allowing
more
energy
throughout
the
day
and
higher
fat
burning
i
rouse
myself
from
lying
on
mase's
lap
inverted
i
know
but
his
little
fingers
tugging
on
my
hair
is
heaven
i
ask
helen
why
are
the
butterflies
bad
baby
the
other
thing
i
turn
to
is
music
and
so
having
said
all
that
i
would
like
to
share
with
you
an
extremely
special
recording
this
cheers
me
up
when
i
am
down
one
senior
figure
says
there
are
some
who
say
this
is
a
blip
i
don
t
buy
that
we
are
not
john
major
s
government
yet
but
if
we
don
t
get
our
act
together
by
the
party
conference
in
the
autumn
we
will
be
in
trouble
i
think
i
ve
worked
out
the
problem
in
nos
10
and
11
they
are
not
that
bright
they
all
like
to

that

asian

school
children
in

and

have
for
years
been
beaten
up
by

people
in
the
mainstream
media
who
go
ballistic
if
some
kid
says
something
unkind
on
the
internet
about
a
homosexual
classmate
nevertheless
hear
no
evil
see
no
evil
and
speak
no

when

are
beaten

why
are

a

old
other
that
this
one
okay
this
was
not
really
a
question
i
got
but
felt
the
need
to
address
it
because
i
am
a
poor
excuse
for
a
blogger
i
finally
figured
out
how
to
sort
of
use

so
hopefully
i
will
get
some
good

you

by

spread

if
then
fun
finds
i
am
very
grateful
to
james
bradley
and
daniel
lloyd
for
their
generosity
and
courage
it
must
have
been
quite
a
leap
of
faith
to
 
cast
out
into
the
deep
 
by
leaving
the
anglican
communion
to
enter
pope
benedict
xvi's
newly
erected
ordinariate
or
as
fr
james
has
apparently
and
humorously
put
it
leaving
the
gatehouse
to
move
into
the
manor
house
i
am
also
very
grateful
to
all
those
who
have
decided
to
enter
into
full
communion
with
the
catholic
church
whilst
holding
onto
their
anglican
patrimony
by
becoming
members
of
the
ordinariate
these
men
women
and
children
are
ecclesiastical
pioneers
leading
the
way
on
the
path
of
real
and
lasting
christian
unity
thanks
should
also
be
given
go
to
all
those
catholics
who
have
embraced
the
holy
father's
project
by
welcoming
the
ordinariate
into
the
wider
church
but
of
course
none
of
this
would
have
been
possible
without
the
extraordinarily
wise
generous
and
prophetic
vision
of
the
pope
himself
for
whose
leadership
it
is
right
to
cry
out
deo
gratias
i
hope
we
are
still
on
speaking

crossing
horace

george

deeded
the

for

they
hardly
expected
a

up
around
it

occurred
after
charles

donated
the
site
for
another
station

siding
years
earlier
but
it
was
a
nice
if
these
things
seem
a
bit
excessive
the
reader
should
bear
in
mind
the
earlier
point
about
how
the
resources
the
police
bring
to
bear
on
a
crime
are
roughly
proportional
to
its
seriousness
if
you
plan
to
be
driving

people's
doors

pointing
guns
at
their
heads
and
threatening
to
shoot
them
if
they
refuse

give
you
the

you
had
better
expect
the

to
start
pulling
out
all
the
stops
and
the
longer
you
get
away
with
it
the
deeper
they

this
falafel
wrapped
andouille
was
going
to
use
a
hot
dog
but
i
found
these
amazing
sausages
worked
way
better
than
i
ever
thought
it
would
with
the
corn
dog
as
inspiration
wrapping
the
sausage
with
my
homemade
falafel
mix
and
frying
in
safflower
oil
proved
to
be
a
fantastic
idea
i
made
a
quick
sauce
of
greek
yogurt
roasted
red
pepper
and
cucumber
that
gave
just
enough
freshness
to
pair
with
the

since
we
d
waited
a
little
late
to
actually
plan
this
trip
our
ticket
situation
had
been
tricky
for
the
weekend
days
of
the
meet
it
s
a
huge
event
among
dutch
speedskating
fans
and
most
of
the
tickets
sold
out
quite
early
on
this
particular
day
we
had
not
been
able
to
buy
enough
seats
for
the
five
of
us
so
john
ryan
and
i
were
ticketed
in
the
standing
room
only
corners
i
e
the
party
zone
of
the
oval
a
tentative
thread
binds
us
still
one
day
a
construction
worker
left
the
job
a
little
early
and
when
he
got
home
he
found
his
wife
in
bed
with
another
man
purple
with
rage
he
hauled
the
man
down
the
stairs
and
into
the
garage
where
he
proceeded
to
secure
his
in
a
vice
now
my
last
post
was
about
my
love
of
old
hymns
more
specifically
i
reposted
a
montage
of
old
hymns
and
their
lyrics
as
they
display
the
gospel
message
the
reason
i
love
old
hymns
and
the
reason
i
love
secret
church
are
one
in
the
same
they
both
speak
concentrated
truth
that
penetrates
my
mind
and
soul
there
is
something
unique
about
the
eloquence
and
unabashed
lyrics
in
old
hymns
just
as
there
is
something
unique
about
uniting
with
50
000
people
in
70
countries
to
learn
together
pray
for
the
persecuted
church
and
worship
by
devoting
ourselves
to
his
word
we
split
up
just
after
rathfarnham
marcin
heading
back
to
his
beautiful
baby
girl
mr
m
to
whatever
it
is
that
the
childless
do
on
a
sunday
i
checked
my
clock
and
saw
that
i
had
plenty
of
time
to
shower
change
pedals
and
have
a
little
rewarmup
before
starting
my
spin
at
12
it
felt
good
to
have
done
three
hours
and
to
still
feel
strong
and
ready
for
the
rest
of
the
day
i
wished
that
i
had
made
more
use
of
the
weather
since
i'd
been
back
made
more
of
an
effort
to
get
out
i
looked
forward
to
the
remaining
warmish
weeks
and
putting
in
some
serious
mileage
glowing
with
all
those
good
endorphins
i
gave
a
little
kick
on
the
brief
incline
up
to
orwell
road
i
checked
right
as
i
approached
the
left
hand
turn
clear
i
would
have
called
had
i
been
with
the
boys
and
then
my
hands
came
off
the
bars
when
all
was
said
and
done
we
had
7
minutes
left
for
our
final
block
of
the
day
we
got
filmed
in
our
last
7
minutes
in
relief
society
and
then
they
went
and
did
a
mock
early
morning
seminary
class
which
mckay
conveniently
forgot
to
tell
us
about
so
he
could
go
home
i
guess
the
kids
changed
into
school
clothes
for
that
shoot
we
were
home
eating
dinner
by
that
time
i
am
sure

i
do
not

to
paint
a

that
i
was
any
kind
of
runway
model
before
i
had
a
baby
and
whether
i
was
or
was
not
is
not
the
issue
it
is
more
about
things
changing
from
how
i
have
always
known
them
to
be
i
have
never
been
big
on
change
so
having
been
accustomed
to
so
many
things
about
myself
and
seeing
them
change
whether
i
wanted
them
to
or
not
was
is
not
always
easy
there
have
been
times
i
did
not
feel
like
myself
not
comfortable
in
my
own
skin
and
i
am
just
now
getting
around
to
being
used
to
the
new
me
i
have
been
asked
several
times
how
do
i
get
my
digitals
to
be
so
detailed
and
clean
said
i
confess
in
much
the
same
way
as
i
have
an
inoperable
brain
tumor
or
my
ability
to
think
has
just
been
wished
away
by
a
vengeful
fairy
godmother
and
i
am
going
to
spend
the
rest
of
my
life
camped
in
centrelink
yeah
shark
films
rule
they
manage
to
all
at
once
be
horrendously
disappointing
mainly
just
on
the
basis
that
they
are
not
jaws
except
for
jaws
which
is
obviously
jaws
and
being
unbelievably
exciting
and
satisfying
simply
because
irrespective
of
all
else
they
ve
got
great
big
sharks
eating
stuff
in
them
i
love
them
stay
tuned
for
my
further
adventures
beneath
the
sea
and
in
the
depths
of
my
dvd
collection
where
i
will
explore
such
important
issues
as
what
happens
when
you
cross
a
shark
with
an
octopus
and
can
you
actually
fit
sharks
in
venetian
canals
an
unfiltered
warmer
interesting
pours
the
appropriate
reddish
amber
with
a
nice
tan
head
that
gets
pillowy
before
receding
the
unfiltered
appearance
is
nice
mind
you
i
am
not
a
faster
per
say
not
that
i
do
not
like
it
but
i
just
never
have
been
a
faster
so
this
year
i
needed
some
prayers
answered
and
the
word
says
that
these
things
come
by
prayer
and
fasting
please
note
i
don
t
drink
double
double
i
think
a
double
double
tastes

just
a

for

please
do

birkeland

get

they
do

i

if
i

i'd
pack
up
the

and

the

anti
zionism
contained
classic
anti

policies
as
demonstrated
by
the
statute
of
the
jews
that
could
be
compared
to
the

statute
of
the
jews
except
that
it
developed
over
a
long
time
in
a
huge
geographical
area
and
at
different
periods
jews
were
accused
of
being
coresponsible
with
israel
for
the
war
that
the
arab
states
declared
against
the
new
state
and
then
lost
regardless
of
their
ideological
affiliation
communist

and
so
on
they
were
subjected
to
special
laws
specifically
aimed
at
jews
they
were
expelled
from
all
arab
muslim
countries
because
a
collective
responsibility
was
imputed
to
them

something
we

that
is
changing

than
we
would
like
this

was
built
on
the
inventiveness
and
ingenuity
that
our
democracy
encourages
but
as
we
are
effective
in
spreading
democracy
and

throughout
the
world
so
will
our
abilities
to
create
some
of
the

in

are
now
coming
out
of
former

current

these
people
were
bottled
up
for
years
and
now
they
are
exploding
everywhere
they
are
now
owning
our
sports
teams

and
lending
obscene

of
money
to

for

of

city
escapes
in

i
saw
the

winding
down

leaving
yugiri
to
be
pulled
into
a
river
i
saw
the
prayers
steam
off
the
water
in

morning
sun
as
the
river
flowed
through
the
rainforest
past
a
tiger
and
a
mouse
deer
drinking
from
it
past
malay
kampongs
and
aboriginal
longhouses
and
chinese
squatter
settlements
i
saw
a
farmer
in
his
paddy
field
by
the
river's
edge
uncrook
his
back
and
gaze
upwards
to
the
sky
feeling
a
cool
breeze
on
his
face
and
a
long
moment
of
unexplained
contentment
yes
annabella

m

question
myself

stood
watching

she
had
a

off
she
was

she

lived

he
also
fell
into

ill
to

and
tries
to
survive
on

once
a
month
he
gets
chemo
treatment
at
a
public
hospital
there
is
also
an
indian
woman
who
was
kicked
out
of
her
community
because
she
became
a
christian
and
in
one
corner
of
the
camp
a
group
of
black
squatters
was
taken
in
 
for
political
reasons
 
after
they
moved

i
have
hit

me

so
i
think
it
is
safe
to
say
that
conditions
up
there
right
now
are
about
as
perfect
as
they
could
possibly
be
for
this

acclimation

think
wednesday's
conditions
were
capable
of
being
even

a
typical

this

was
certainly
a

that
these

are
known
for
in

i
briefly
saw
only

i
spent
the
vast

this

analysis

the

the

of
the

into
perspective
in
one
of
europe
s
strongest
performing

i
had
suggested
to
them
that
the
center
focus
operated
more
like
darken
lighten
center
from
color
efex
pro
and
it
looks
like
thats
what
we
re
seeing
in
the
new
update
i
m
so
pleased
with
the
way
this
tool
works
now
i
rarely
used
center
focus
before
but
now
i
think
i
ll
be
using
it
a
lot
more
often
now
that
there
are
a
number
of
great
presets
and
you
have
the
ability
to
set
the
point
of
center
focus
i
think
its
got
to
be
the
best
vignette
tool
on
the
iphone
now
because
of
how
natural
it
looks
there
will
be
cynics
who
will
suspect
any
projections
issued
by
the
central
bank
of
ireland
on
property
prices
there
are
some
who
will
claim
that
the
bank
made
itself
a
hostage
to
fortune
in
march
2011
when
it
used
baseline
and
adverse
scenarios
for
future
property
prices
to
assist
with
estimating
the
capital
requirements
of
banks
and
cynics
might
suggest
it
is
in
the
bank
s
own
interest
to
undershoot
the
adverse
estimate
in
order
to
avoid
additional
calls
on
taxpayers
funds
to
prop
up
the

however
i
will
be
at

for
those
who
advocate
compassion
and
forgiveness
for
people
who
were
born
into

that
tortured
them
in
unimaginable
ways

gave

not

8
students
have
developed
the
analytical
reading
skills
to
read
understand
and
analyze
both
literary
and
informational
texts
additionally
these
students
successfully
read
and
understand
many
different
types
of
texts
across
subjects
students
should
be
able
to
determine
what
unfamiliar
words
mean
based
on
how
they
are
used
students
should
also
grasp
how
authors
use
language
differently
depending
on
their
purpose
and
the
literary
genre
meanwhile
my
husband
amazes
me
with
an
attention
to
details
that
completely
skip
over
my
head
offender

when
the
items
we
perfected
over
weeks
months
years
are
met
with
oohs
and
ahhs
and
smiles
there
is
no
better
feeling
on
earth
but
sometimes
our
brilliant
idea
is
many
people
think
that
children
need
this
and
that
a
ton
of
toys
clothes
etc
when
really
what
kids
need
most
is
love
acceptance
support
and
encouragement
from
the
people
they
love
and
look
up
to
every
time
a
policeman
gets
a
look
at
me
i
can
see
the
wheels
starting
to
turn
in
his
head
he
s
positive
that
i
m
on
his
wanted
list
for
at
least
three
major
crimes
so
what
do
you
think
with
on
our
side
like
this
how
can
we
lose
if
didn
t
hesitate
to
put
everything
on
the
line
for
us
embracing
our
condition
and
exposing
himself
to
the
worst
by
sending
his
own
son
is
there
anything
else
he
wouldn
t
gladly
and
freely
do
for
us
and
who
would
dare
tangle
with
by
messing
with
one
of
s
chosen
who
would
dare
even
to
point
a
finger
the
one
who
died
for
us
who
was
raised
to
life
for
us
is
in
the
presence
of
at
this
very
moment
sticking
up
for

do
you
think
anyone
is
going
to
be
able
to
drive
a
wedge
between
us
and

for

there
is
no
way
not
trouble
not
hard
times
not
hatred
not
hunger
not
homelessness
not
bullying
threats
not
backstabbing
not
even
the
worst
sins
listed
in

i
m
absolutely
convinced
that
nothing
nothing
living

dead
angelic
or
demonic
today
or
tomorrow
high
or

thinkable
or

absolutely
nothing
can

lots

about

see
these

are
relevant
when
talking
about

because
the
classic
notions
of

space

need
to
be
adapted

my

i
had
picked
my

ahead

from
a
my

paper
pack
in
my
stash
and
coordinated
my
coloring
to
match
much
easier
than
coloring

especially
when
one
finds
out
the
paper
you
have
in

is

lol
i
die
cut
some
of

and
used
pre

that
came
with

as

i
felt
like
it
needed

hanging
off

i
was

so
heavenly
father
we
come
to
you
and
we
know
deep
down
in
our
hearts
that
this
does
not
describe
us
i
know
it
doesn
t
describe
me
and
i
m
ashamed
at
that
lord
give
us
the
strength
to
turn
to
you
in
suffering
not
to
lash
out
at
those
around
us
or
to
be
poisoned
by
depression
or
bitterness
suffering
produces
faith
perfect
us
in
the
image
of
your
son
and
because
the
characters
are
written
real
the
relationships
and
fractures
between
them
are
delivered
with
the
gravitas
humour
and
unpredictability
of
real
life
for
those
that
never
had
experience
with
these
critters
they
can
build
nests
in
walls
and
you
may
find
yourself
covered
with
them
while
you
sleep
they
do
not
bite
they
grab
with
their
mandibles
and
sting
like
a
wasp
the
toxin
is
painful
and
can
cause
severe
allergic
reactions
at
best
the
sting
leaves
an
irritating
pistule
at
worst
the
result
may
be
a
trip
to
the
hospital
or
death
entry

if
you
have
kids
this
is
a
great
thing
to
have

for

for

all
the
ingredients
are
pronounceable
it
isn

full

seriously
since
i
love
paper
so
much
and
have
been
on
a
search
for
cute
file
folders
for
the
past
7
years
i
had
just
picked
up
some
new
cute
ones
at
michael's

for
1
dollar
and
3
for
1
at
target
dollar
spot
i
have
been
thinking
about
a
command
center
for
a
little
while
i
have
a
couple
of
projects
in
process
for
this
in
our
household
so
you
will
have
to
get
by
with
just
a
few
pictures
of
what
i
completed
tonight
i
will
post
more
when
i
finish
the
rest
of
the
project
so
i
went
around
my
house
and
gathered
everything
that
i
thought
could
work
for
a
command
center
like
what
toni
at
abowlfulloflemons
blogspot
com
made
here
were
my
options
for
much
better
pictures
of
the
whole
day
here
are
the
blogs
of
all
the
attendees
who
will
have
there
own
top
picks
from
the
event
i
am
calling
the
doctor
again
tomorrow
to
see
if
there
is
anything
he
would
suggest
or
he
can
do
to
speed
things
up
ron
is
not
suicidal
but
he
recognizes
that
his
anti
depressant
is
not
doing
enough
he
sent
his
handgun
home
with
rex
tonight
he
said
there
is
no
telling
what
someone
who
descends
into
deep
depression
is
capable
of
and
what
will
happen
if
they
reach
that
point
of
no
return
amy
and
i
each
tried
to
tell
him
how
important
it
is
to
focus
on
finding
even
just
one
thing
no
matter
how
small
to
find
joy
in
he
seems
to
be
in
a
better
frame
of
mind
tonight
the
light
to
see
the
next
step
ahead
on
the
path
but
without
you
i
give
up
one
wonders
how
a
nation's
intelligence
resists
the
radio
moreover
it
does
not
resist
the
radio
is
a
faucet
of
foolishness
the
only
thing
i
can
bear
listening
to
is
the
sports
reporting
the
high
speed
precision
of
the
speakers
they
are
forbidden
stupidity
which
exists
only
in
the
fact
that
some
men
are
kicking
a
ball
around
a
field
and
the
whole
world
is
excited

the
fact

expanding

having
secured

in

that
was
often
enough
for

i
was

was

generally
speaking
last
night
at
work
was
one
of
my
all
time
worst
nights
i
know
i
say
that
almost
every
week
but
i
mean
it
this
time
it
made
me
think
that
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
give
the
out
there
that
have
no
idea
of
how
to
act
in
a
restaurant
some
hints
but
easily
the
best
part
of
my
afternoon
of
shopping
was
the
company
you
see
as
i
was
heading
off
to
shop
i
ran
into
the
ever
delightful
patricia
shackelford
and
she
was
totally
game
to
take
part
in
this
completely
rudder
less
adventure
i
had
a
nice
lie
in
then
i
went
for
lunch
with
my
daughter
and
lpf
who
was
very
well
behaved
sat
in
her
high
chair
and
entertained
everyone
with
her
giggles
bangings
and
general
carrying
on
then
we
went
back
to
my
daughter's
and
had
a
nice
cuppa
and
a
birthday
chocolate
cupcake
an
afternoon
of
fun
and
frolic
with
lpf
is
the
perfect
birthday
present
i
have
an
email
packet
that
i
can
send
you
which
further
explains
all
of
this
information
including
pricing
a

and

if
you
have
any
additional
questions
please
let
me
know
i
am
happy
to
help
i
remember
giving
birth
to
my
daughter
on
the
night
of
april
6
2000
just
the
night
before
i
had
written
the
following
letter
to
her
and
what
about
the
bit
of
philosophical
dialog
at
the
tea
party
my
friends
are
much
better
people
than
this
the
people
i
choose
to
surround
myself
with
are
supportive
considerate
trustworthy
honest
and
kind
my
trainer
for
instance
a
terrific
person
who
has
been
crapped
on
several
times
in
her
life
someone
burglarized
her
barn
not
just
once
but
twice
this
woman
does
not
have
a
palace
and
works
so
hard
for
what
she
has
why
should
she
be
the
person
to
lose
so
much
i
often
ask
that
question
his

what

but
he

i
do
not
know
the
how
or
the
why
of
my
trainer
needing
to
be
burglarized
twice
but
has
the
plan
i
need
the
faith
to
follow
what
his
plan
is
for
me
and
my
friends
i
do
pray
and
i
include
my
trainer
in
my
prayers
so
goodbye
to
fool

day
here
s
remembering
my
favourite
character
the
fool
giving
the
audience
my
favourite
quote
in
my
favourite
shakespeare
play
king
lear
that
decision
only
made
a
difference
once
when
my
attendance
at
early
morning
religious
classes
called
seminary
was
low
and
my
bishop
tried
to
encourage
me
to
attend
more
often
he
pointed
out
that
to
get
into
byu
you
had
to
pass
seminary
i
smiled
explained
that
i
was
not
interested
in
byu
anyway
and
he
let
the
matter
drop
i
still
went
to
seminary
from
time
to
time
but
never
enough
to
pass
i
wish
now
that
i'd
attended
more
often
i
wonder
if
byu
allowed
beards
would
the
bishop's
attempt
to
encourage
me
have
carried
more
weight

and
while
i
appreciated
kazushi's
care
for
preservation
of
the
3d
texture
of
the
sound
i
noted
several
problems
with
superposition
of
various
parts
of
the
orchestra
in
the
first
act
it
all
sounded
very
good
in
the
second
act
and
eventually
was

now

me
this
is
the
part
that
requires
creative
energy
on

fleshing
out

rewording

so

this

from

painters
exhibit
here's
the
info
then
yesterday
i
participated
in
a
local
5k
run
i
had
planned
to
do
the
jog
a
little
bit
then
mostly
walk
then
repeat
that
i
had
read
about
and
that
i
thought
my
fellow
optifaster
had
done
in
disneyland
but
i
actually
jogged
about
65
70
of
the
trail
amazingly
for
me
because
i
was
doing
ok
and
also
due
to
peer
pressure
since
everyone
else
was
jogging
and
i
had
lots
of
people
slimmer
than
me
and
younger
than
me
behind
me
so
i
was
thinking
wow
i
m
pretty
good
although
of
course
it
was
only
3
miles
and
a
half
marathon
is
15
and
finally
do
you
have
any
advice
to
give
any
up
and
coming
or
aspiring
djs
who
would
you
want
to
meet
so
for
2012
i
m
doing
it
again
yes
i
did
order
components
for
4
albums
one
of
those
sets
will
be
my
2012
album
the
other
3
are
for
the
extra
pictures
that
i
still
have
in
a
box
if
i
can
get
them
in
albums
and
then
add
the
journaling
i
will
actually
be
caught
up
on
scrapbooking
that
would
never
happen
with
the
way
i
use
to
scrapbook
each
breath
stunted
that
the
gmc
and
other
medical
licensing
authorities
are
not
doing
anything
about
torturing
patients
tells
you
a
lot
about
the
power
of
the
cdc
and
the
cbt
psychiatrists
then
when
the
answers
have
been
checked
they
go
onto
our
computer
program
insight
that
throws
out
the
questions
in
random
order
anyway
with
the
dispute
between
scone
and
scone
resolved
conclusively
in
favour
of
scone
i
am
satisfied
that
the
next
time
i
write
to
the
bbc
demanding
that
they
sack
a
presenter
for
saying
scone
then
my
complaint
will
be
taken
rather
more
seriously

walking
again
in

north

side
the

i
came
across
a
collection
of

quartz
which
someone
had
gathered
from
the

the
previous
day
and
left
in
the
littoral

it
was
still
there
even
after
the

had

i

them

along

someone
sneezes
this

looks

i
had
to
bypass
several
others
just
so
i
can
read
it
it
lives
out

this
cuteness
until
about
halfway
through
and
then
i
thought
hmm
i
could
have
survived
not
reading
it
as
quickly
as
i
did

i
was
intrigued
but
hesitant
i
kept
wondering
if
i
would
really
want
to
or
be
able
to
show
my
scars
to
strangers
and
expose
myself
like
that
but
after
i
emailed
another
young
woman
who
had
already
participated
and
she
urged
me
to
go
for
it
i
was
excited
to
make
the
trek
as
memory
struggles
with
realization
rinse
and
repeat
i
thought
you
already
ran
your
marathon
why
would
you
train
to
do
it
again
i
have
no
idea
but
i
can
t
help
myself
you
d
think
after
2
of
our
own
kids
fostering
and
what
not
we
d
have
it
out
of
our
system
by
now
but
noooo
we
wanted
one
more
sometimes
i
just
need
to
stop
making
minis
for
a
while
and
enjoy
a
bit
of
crafting
for
myself
the
green
fairy
has
inspired
these
two
accessories
this
is
just
my
method
and
it
has
served
me
well
to
the
one
who
asked
the
question
i
hope
i
answered
it
i
hope
you
find
the
way
that
works
for
you
cliche
we
all
have
to
go
through
it
you
can
t
avoid
it
so
ride
it
don
t
fight
it
minimize
the
damage
and
then
rebuild
it
did
one
of
the
friends
is
one
that
i
have
known
since
high
school
for
a
few
years
we
were
inseparable
her
parents
were
like
a
second
set
of
parents
to
me
we
grow
apart
our
senior
year
which
now
but
we
were
both
immature
about
things
and
our
friendship
ended
i
am
sorry
that
it
ended
but
i
know
that
s
part
of
life
i
know
that
i
am
getting
better
at
looking
at
the
big
picture
and
basing
my
willingness
to
change
on
that
rather
than
a
knee
immediate
rebuff
and
steadfast
resistance
is
it
wisdom
is
it
an
eagerness
to
stretch
and
gather
in
all
the
experiences
this
life
has
to
offer
even
if
that
means
stepping
out
into
the
unknown
i
had
a
request
for
this
matt
dennis
lp
which
i
am
particularly
happy
to
provide
at
this
time
because
it
contains
two
seasonal
songs
oh
and
remember
i
asked
your
advice
on
bag
decisions
well
i
was
thiiiis
close
on

confirm
 
on
a
large
chloe
paraty

yesterday
but
i
somehow
got
myself
to
click

on

well
with
research
i
found
the
cc

in
the
color
taupe
i
am
thinking
it
will
be
perfect
it
has
not
be
 
released
 
yet
so
i
am
in
contact
with
the
buyer
to
get
the

s
and
i
think
that
will
be
my
new
bag
and
will
save
me

of

have

many

it

yes

worse

at

point
i
really
wanted
to
get
off

walk

i
was
worried
that
if
i
stopped
i'd
topple
over
into
the
road
and
get
hit
by
a
car
so
i
just
kept
pedaling

all
in

morning
at
mile

my
mare
refused
to
cross
a
river
that
swelled
overnight
to
frightening
heights
for
a
pony
so
i
dismounted
and
entered
the
water
to
reassure
her
for
the
next
several
miles
my
cold
wet
breeches
chafed
my
calves
raw
the
overnight
rain
also
knocked
down
trail
markers
between
miles
16
and
22
which
meant
most
of
us
added
an
unnecessary
loop
to
climb
heartbreak
hill
twice
hugs
all
round
you
will
also
be
responsible
for
the
results
of
that
wait
and
see
plan
i'd
like
to
point
out
katrina
as
a
history
lesson
for
those
who
wait
and
ignore
warnings
of
trouble
ahead
i
tried
six
or
so
bows
and
decided
on
the
recurve
you
see
in
the
image
i
have
got
alot
of
practicing
to
do
but
i
have
got
a
knack
for
it
i
think
my
goal
for
the
next
3
months
is
to
to
be
able
to
put
80
90
of
my
arrows
into
a
7
circle
from
a
variety
of
ranges
thus
far
i
have
been
shooting
from
13
18
yards
but
would
like
to
have
accuracy
up
to
30
40
yards
i
am
initially
just
working
on
having
good
form
and
building
up
strength
in
all
the
muscles
involved
my
intent
is
to
shoot
60
arrows
a
day
though
i
expect
it
will
be
a
month
or
so
before
i
can
do
that
everyday
i
will
work
up
to
it
for
the
past
six
months
james
and
i
have
spent
a
peaceful
hour
together
on
saturday
mornings
at
r
e
a
d
the
weekly
hour
long
class
focuses
on
reading
enrichment
and
development
through
movement
music
art
and
creative
play
i
wish
i
had
known
about
the
program
when
luz
was
little
because
i
know
she
would
have
enjoyed
it
james
looks
forward
to
saturday
mornings
and
i
do
too
not
just
for
what
it
provides
him
but
because
i
like
the
one
on
one
time
together
at
the
end
of
each
class
the
kids
can
check
out
a
backpack
that
centers
around
a
book
s
or
a
theme
last
week
we
had
10
little
monkeys
this
week
we
have
a
zoo
themed
backpack
the
socialization
and
the
learning
that
happens
on
saturday
mornings
at

a

worth
every
penny
of

he
might
not
know
his
colors
but
he
can
sit
still
for
and
appreciate
a
good
story
let's
see
if
this
increases
his
chances
of
getting
into
our
nursery
school
choice
next
fall
truly
nothing
is
automatic
in
the
world
of
education
these
days
it
s
beginning
to
look
a
lot
like
christmas
homeland
security
and
border
patrol
officers
were
following
the
2001
dodge
durango
at
the
time
because
authorities
suspected
the
passengers
were
illegal
immigrants
according
to
the
casa
grande
police
department
i
decided
i
wanted
to
do
something
with
my
slightly
hoardish
collection
of
mirrors
that
i
had
gathered
from
various
places
the
past
year
most
of
the
mirrors
were
from
thrift
stores
with
the
exception
of
one
that
i
bought
at
a
country
auction
in
arizona
i
d
prefer
to
have
this
pattern
with
a
pencil
skirt
and
without
the
front
pleats
those
pleats
seem
to
be
a
bit
unnecessary
considering
you
ll
have
either
a
peplum
or
funny
hiding
them
and
i
don
t
think
the
bring
much
to
the
party
shape
wise
in
perpetration
i
have
been
studying
world
building
for
hex
crawls
initiative
systems
and
more
hearts
undoubtedly
have
a
squad
capable
of
finishing
third
this
season
but
then
they
have
a
squad
capable
of
that
every
season
and
don
t
always
manage
to
do
it
the
romanov
ride
seems
to
be
coming
to
an
end
and
it
just
wouldn
t
be
fitting
to
end
with
a
whimper
the
off
field
troubles
have
undoubtedly
affected
results
on
the
pitch
and
will
continue
to
do
so
until
a
takeover
is
achieved
romanov
may
well
need
to
asjust
his
special
offer
of
50
million
quid
though
perhaps
a
leaf
out
of

or

and
take
up
to

off
that
price
or
pretend
they

the

is

the
case
the
result
was
announced
immediately
after
the
closing
of
the
polling
stations
at
8pm
on
a
sunday
evening
i
remember
the
faces
of
shock
and
surprise
and
a
moment
of
confusion
before
it
became
clear
that
le
pen
would
continue
into
the
second
round

the
overview
of
the
visitor
tab
tells
you
the
total
number
of
visitors
over
a
period
of
one
month
however
if
you
look
closer
there
is
so
much
more
to
see
absolute
unique
visitors
are
the
total
number
of
first
time
visits
which
are
calculated
as
a
percentage
of
the
total
in
the
case
of
my
hypothetical
blog
there
are
733
visits
total
and
344
unique
this
equates
to
41
4
new
visits
for
the
period
the
visitor
to
this
blog
spent
on
average
of
3
42
minutes
on
the
site
reading
and
2
19
average
page
views
what
this
tells
the
blogger
is
that
their
subject
matter
is
interesting
enough
for
the
visitor
to
continue
beyond
the
landing
page
in
this
example
there
are
1608
total
page
views
the
number
that
is
the
best
indicator
over
time
is
the
number
of
unique
visitors
because
as
that
number
increases
and
bounce
rate
decreases
it
tells
the
author
that
their
blog
is
becoming
increasingly
more
popular
if
the
average
minutes
on
the
site
increases
the
bounce
rate
will
decrease
correspondingly

not

the

health

they
provide

in

i
love
salads
olives
and
olive

so
i
was
so
excited
when
the
international
olive

contacted
me
about
posting
about
their
new

of

none

i
ve
seen
some
major
fashion
faux
pas
here
but
rarely
would
i
think
of
the
wearer
as
a
slob
so
much
as
just
someone
who
failed
at
taking
a
fashion
risk
or
just
doesn
t
really
know
what
looks
good
on
them
in
america
people
don

even
try
around

could

i
am

s

which
may
change

the

does
delineating
how
much

i
guess
at
the
end
of

day
nothing
beats
word
of

for
getting
yourself
a
new
job
and
so
6
months
and
1
day
later
i
am
gainfully
employed
and
it
is
in
exactly
what
i
want
to
build
experience
in
life
was
so
good
yesterday
and
now
it
is
even
better
the
answer
requires
taking
a
further
step
back
and
to
acknowledge
one
of
the
powerful
imperatives
which
direct
human
behaviour
the
parental
commitment
to
the
development
of
the
child
that
all
pervasive
contribution
to
the
societal
structure
of
the
succeeding
generation
however
sometimes
our
instincts
get
driven
undercover
become
discoloured
or
influenced
by
other
things
that
go
on
in
our
lives
i
am
going
to
go
in
to
these
concepts
in
more
depth
in
my
next
few
blogs
but
for
now
a
message
from
who
knows
but
it
came
to
me
this
morning
next
i
am
to
blindfold
myself
and
walk
out
on
a
freeway
now
i
wasn
t
born
yesterday
in
fact
i
was
born
19
935
yesterdays
ago
so
i
am
not
going
to
fall
for
this
trick
to
try
to
eliminate
me
and
my
humble
little
blog
from
blogland
also
i
have
better
uses
for
my
blindfold
which
i
will
most
likely
be
using
in
the
coming
days
though
going
into
detail
about
said
blindfold
use
might
make
me
appear
more
like
elizabeth
berkley
in
showgirls
rather
than
grace
kelly
in

and
i
want
to
maintain
a
bit
of

i
go
about

missing

was
taken
by

by
a

was
and
is

the
highest

austin
faltered
a
bit
but
once
more
said
no
how
about
you
which
five
nonfiction
books
would
you
want
with
you
if
you
were
doomed
to
spend
a
long
time
on
a
deserted
island
my
body
is
sore
today
and
i
am
loving
it
you
know
that
feeling
you
get
when
you
ve
pushed
yourself
hard
but
you
know
you
are
doing
the
right
thing
that
s
the
way
i
m
feeling
today
i
am
enjoying
being
pushed
in
new
ways
it
s
been
awhile
since
i
ve
pushed
myself
out
of
a
comfort
zone
but
doing
my
three
workouts
so
far
this
week
i
know
i
m
on
my
way
to
a
totally
new
adventure
this
summer
and
it
s
exciting
and
it
s
also
got
me
thinking
about
who
i
ve
become
during
this
journey
already
to
fight
the
war
with
the
satanic
ghoul
every
time
i
look
at
kleenex
i
review
this
part
of
my
life
and
i
think
of
crying
at
her
bedside
telling
her
goodbye
and
that
s
one
thing
i
ll
always
have
and
never
lose
i
ve
loved
traditional
music
since
i
was
a
child
one
of
the
themes
of
the
book
is
what
you
pass
down
to
the
next
generation
in
an
early
draft
a
character
tells
josie
that
we
can
still
hear
the
dead
talk
through
the
songs
that
are
passed
down
through
the
ages
i
believe
that
i
wanted
a
way
to
link
the
book
into
the
voices
of
the
people
of
the
time
therapy
is
the
use
of
one
s
internally
or
externally
to
heal
wounds
or
alleviate
disease
symptoms
and
or
for
overall
well
being
it
is
also
called
uropathy
auto
therapy
amaroli
or
shivambu
i
wish
my
excitement
for
this
show
could
back
to
the
way
it
was
in
the
first
half
of
the
season
because
what
we
have
is
worth
the
pain
has
it
s
moments
but
the
writing
is
too
inconsistent
at
this
point
and
it
s
looking
less
and
less
likely
that
this
show
will
deliver
a
satisfying
conclusion
to
these
chain
of
events
or
go
further
than
this
series
all
seniors
their
families
caregivers
and
friends
are
invited
to
attend
the
trial
which
has
just
ended
was
also
notable
for
exposing
the
trauma
of
young
people
who
witness
stephen's
friend
duwayne
brooks
was
quizzed
about
differences
in
his
account
in
court
and
his
original
statement
s
to
police
mr
brooks
now
a
councillor
giving
evidence
just
after
the
death
of
his
father
explained
that
he
had
suffered
post
traumatic
stress
disorder
after
stephen's
from
the
bbc's
court
report
a
few
of
our
recent
favorites
this
song
which
was
performed
by
the
carpenters
is
one
that
celebrates
singing
clearly
you
don
t
always
hear
happy
songs
but
i
must
say
those
are
my
favorites
our
online
casino
has
all
the
slots
are
no
different
from
the
real

machines
so
that
you
can
start
playing
for
real
money
immediately
after
the
registration
every
day
we
accrue
fun
chips
for
the
fact
that
you
could

i
had
some
fun
making
this
i
was
thinking
it
would
look
lovely
on
my
front
door
but
alas
no
so
i
thought
i
would
make
another
one
when
i
get
some
pennies
this
one
however
will
not
be
waisted
i
am
sure
i
will
be
popping
this
into
my
folksy
shop
with
any
luck
some
one
will
love
it
lots
enough

buy

students
at

school
this
week
were
clearing
the
hall
too
slowly
in
the
opinion
of

officer
assigned
to
the
school
so
he
did
something

numbingly
dumb
he
pulled
out
his

and
squirted
it
into
the

the
result

students
ran
down
the
halls
and
out
of
the
school
three
students
were
rushed
to
the
emergency
room
and
more
than
a
dozen
others
were
picked
up
by
their
parents
because
of
difficulty
breathing
the
painting
is
almost
finished
one
of
the
downsides
of
my
painting
process
is
the
wait
while
layers
dry
however
it
s
also
a
positive
because
it
gives

time
to

i
did
like
one
part
of
the
book
which
is
mentioned
in
the
very
last
sentence
on
the
back
of
the

image
mo

i
used
to
make
up
this
sort
of
malarky
for
chatty
taxi
drivers
not
the
dwarf
bit
obviously
it
would
have
hurt
my
knees
but
this
postcard
thing
has
opened
up
a
whole
new
avenue
for
me
so
ireland's
just
an
island
it
is
an
island
of
the
mind
i
need
to
get
the
tiller
going
and
get
everything
tilled
under
a
couple
times
before
planting
time
come
around
i
had
the
chickens
in
the
garden
to
tear
everything
up
and
add
a
little
fertilizer
before
i
moved
them
back
to
the
yard
but
i
will
probably
buy
a
little
bit
of
manure
and
maybe
some
compost
to
add
to
soil
i
should
plant
a
cover
crop
but
i
never
get
around
to
it

let
it
be

we
may
have
been
a

annoying
we
were
directed
to
a
side
room
we
did
not
fancy
so
remained
hovering
in
the
main
tea
room
directed
to
another
table
we
suddenly
saw
that
a
prime
table
by
the
window
was
being
vacated
so
swiftly
nabbed
that
instead
maybe
this
caused
offence
we
sat
there
and
sat
there
then
when
we
asked
if
we
could
order
a
young
woman
dressed
as
a
waitress
informed
us
that
it
was
not
waitress
service
you
have
to
go
to
the
counter
and
pay
in
advance
 
it
is
a
bit
like
russia

thanks
for
all
your

and

what
fantastic
ideas
in
silent
i
played
for
the
rest
of
fourth
and
fifth
grades
and
all
though
middle
school
when
i
was
eleven
it
was
not
considered
cool
to
be
in
the
orchestra
and
i
hated
carrying
the
rental
case
back
and
forth
every
day
my
parents
bought
me
a
violin
case
in
seventh
grade
but
what
i
really
wanted
was
a
violin
of
my
own
they
said
they
wanted
to
wait
to
buy
me
one
until
they
were
sure
i
would
keep
playing

institute
of

all
the
young
geezys
stephen
lawhead
is
an
internationally
acclaimed
author
of
mythic
history
and
imaginative
fiction
he
was
born
in
1950
in
nebraska
in
the
usa
his
early
life
was
lived
in
america
where
he
earned
a
university
degree
in
fine
arts
and
attended
theological
seminary
for
two
years
the
cost
to
the
general
public
and
industry
will
be
enormous
another
reason
why
we
do
not
see
men
selling
their
wares
in

is
and
let
me
know
if
i
am
wrong
about
this
women

my
godmother
kimmie
asked
how
close
paul
and
i
are
to
getting
engaged
truth
in
about
a
year
and
a
half
i
would
guess
she
s
very
excited
about
that
which
is
very
nice
in
other
words
rheticus
work
on
copernicus
wasn
t
singled
out
by
the
index
rather
all
of
his
works
were
proscribed
and
the
index
says
explicitly
why
rheticus's
works
were
there
and
lo
and
behold
it
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
heliocentrism
but
rather
was
due
to
his
connection
with
protestant
scholars
now
it
seems
hard
to
believe
that
bob
didn
t
read
the
last
half
of
that
sentence
so
why
did
he
choose
to
omit
it
in
galileo
was
wrong
or
in
this
most
recent
discussion
with
me
why
would
he
continue
to
give
the
reader
the
impression
that
the
works
of
rheticus
were
put
on
the
index
because
of
their
copernican
ideas
and
then
go
on
to
accuse
me
of
dishonesty
in
supposedly
suppressing
information
from
the
reader
inclusion
and
exclusion
on
the
local
level
citizenship
from
below
me
then
that
is
some

this
is
the
recipe
for
the

we
have

on

it

also
known
as
seven

and
is
my

bev's

yep
only

but
it
lasts
24
mins
so
i
know
that
when
phil
collins
comes
on
i
m
nearly
done
i
ve
gone
for
the
beats
in
the
music
and
how
the
lyrics
make
me
feel
rather
than
pure
taste
i
need
the
inspiration
to
carry
on
at
the
moment
but
when
running
gets
easier
i
m
hoping
that
i
will
beable
to
listen
to
anything
and
just
keep
on

this

i

that
and
it
makes
me
nauseous
blue
skies
felt
by

i
love
to
feed
you
have
a
good
week
ahead
this
morning
i
simply
rinsed
my
face
with
hot
water
in
the
shower
and
then
splashed
it
with
cold
to
shrink
the
pores
gently
towel
dried

applied
just
a

i
am
hoping
to
eventually
not
need
any
moisturizer
at
all
but
we
will
see
my
face
is
super
soft
and
glowy
today
will
definitely
keep
you
updated
on
my
progress
with
this
although
the
chinese
accomplished
their
objective
it
is
important
to
consider
the
challenge
that
south
vietnam
was
faced
with
the
vietnamese
navy
only
had
four
warships
at
their
disposal
compared
to
the
eleven
warships
wielded
by
the
chinese
this
excludes
the
reinforcements
sent
by
the
chinese
on
the
following
days
when
one
looks
at
these
numbers
it
is
obvious
that
the
odds
were
not
in
favour
of
the
republic
of
vietnam
the
vietnamese
soldiers
understood
this
but
were
willing
to
fight
nonetheless
the
united
states
who
were
no
longer
serving
in
vietnam
by
this
time
believed
that
the
south
should
have
quietly
retreated
while
china
advanced
on
the
islands
this
did
not
happen
faced
with
the
impossible
task
of
fighting
off
the
enormous
state
of
china
and
at
the
same
time
dealing
with
the
invaders
from
the
north
the
democratic
south
vietnam
did
everything
in
their
power
to
fight
the
opposing
forces
the
soldiers
of

courageously
fought
to
the

jasper
her
voice
broke
and
he
longed
to
hold
her
to
tell
her
this
wasn
t
the
way
but
her
mind
was
made
up
11
c
were
two
women
one
was
called
wandimirwa
who
was
given
to
gutu
by
that
s
what
the
boy
wonder
said
when
i
told
him
about
the
end
of
a
year
he
is
very
aware
that
may
2
is
his
birthday
and
that
he
ll
turn
6
he
s
been
counting
the
days
he
s
long
had
the
key
dates
of
the
week
memorized
his
birthday
is
may
2
the
avengers
opens
on
may
4
a
friend
s
graduation
is
may
5
his
birthday
party
is
may
6
and
so
is
his
mom
s
birthday
he
can
recite
them
on
cue
if
needed
to
him
this
is
a
huge
birthday
because
what
birthday
s
aren
t
and
i
guess
by
throwing
him
a
party
he
thinks
we
revel
in
the
passing
of
another
year
the
same
way
he
does
when
i
told
him
i
was
somewhat
sad
about
him
turning
6
because
i
really
enjoyed
him
at
5
ian
was
surprised
it
took
him
a
moment
to
process
if
you
just
want
what
is
on
the
surface
when
there
is
nothing
underneath
i
really
like
the
typical
for
moistboyz
and
growing
more
relevant
each
day
anti
american
slant
in
the
opening
songs
i
don
t
give
a
where
the
eagle
flies
uncle
sam
me
captain
america
and
i
have
a
feeling
the
year
of
the
maggot
should
probably
be
about
george
bush
in
i
don
t
give
a
where
the
eagle
flies
some
of
the
lyrics
include
killing
everybody
that
you
don
t
like
are
you
gonna
come
and
me
tonite
it
s
a
good
album
and
i
like
the
mellow
rock
style
in
everybody
s
her
as
well
when
you
play
a
game
you
want
to
sit
down
with
your
controller
and
run
through
a
bunch
of
levels
and
beat
down
the
boss
at
the
end
it
was
pretty
easy
you
don
t
want
to
get
up
and
move
your
arms
around
in
order
to
interact
with
the
game
it
is
too
much
work
it
also
never
works
either
you
end
up
trying
to
position
yourself
perfectly
and
the
game
never
even
detects
your
movements
sorry
microsoft
kinect
playstation
move
and
wii
it
s
the
truth
the
meaning
of
the
term
metrosexual
is
very
simple
and
clear
it
comes
from
metropolis
and
heterosexual
thus
metro
and
it
means
a
metropolitan
man
whose
attributes
are
similar
to
those
of
a
homosexual
man
for
example
they
like
to
shop
for
the
latest
trend
in
fashion
they
like
to
get
manicure
and
pedicure
they
like
to
shave
not
only
hair
but
any
other
hairy
spot
in
their
bodies
etc
this
being
said
leonardo
dicaprio
does
not
necessarily
fall
under
the
metrosexual
category
nor
does
pitt
or
cruise
despite
what
others
may
think
i
think
that
when
it
comes
to
a
celebrity
it
would
be
somewhat
confusing
since
they
have
the
need
to
look
good
even
when
they
don
t
at
times
and
this
relates
to
their
profession
and
social
status
somewhat
not
their
life
style
they
can
be
a
total
different
person
and
dress
very
different
off
cameras
wisdom
of
the
moment
do
not
go
to
campground
bathrooms
at
night
buy
a
port
a
birthday
is
on
christmas
too
so
it
is
double
the
fun
i
loved
making
my
list
telling
santa
what
i
wanted
and
then
the
anticipation
of
waiting
to
open
presents
and
see
if
i
got
what
i
wanted
however
the
cloud
doesn
t
come
without
its
own
problems
as
the
solution
is
hosted
on
the
web
bandwidths
on
broadband
lines
have
to
be
increased
to
cater
for
the
additional
load
of
users
accessing
their
applications
over
the
net
this
also
creates
a
significant
problem
with
data
disconnect
due
to
data
being
segregated
into
data
silos
which
in
turn
inhibits
business
intelligence
tools
finally
there
is
the
issue
of
data
nationalisation
with
opinions
of
governments
ranging
from
openly
hostile
to
storing
their
data
outside
of
their
jurisdiction
to
simply
expressing
a
reservation
this
of
course
has
an
impact
on
not
only
government
department
but
also
the
suppliers
partners
and
service
provides
who
wish
to
work
with
government
departments
some
days
are
exhausting
and
i
feel
like
i
will
never
learn

look

a
fool
but
monday
was

days
if
you
worked
on

do
you
have
an
anecdote
you'd
like
to
share
about
your
experience
of
tharg
and
his
minions
what
are
some
of
your
favourite
children's
books
what
happens
next
seems
inevitable
sooner
or
later
some
creationist
teachers
are
going
to
attempt
to
use
this
law
as
cover
to
teach
creationism
in
public
school
science
classes
they
ll
get
called
out
on
it
and
taken
to
court
they
will
lose
likely
costing
the
state
many
millions
of
dollars
plus
giving
them
much
deserved
embarrassment
in
the
process
your
green
water
pumping
station
building
is
falling
down
and
it
is
rapidly
being
turned
into
a
squatter
camp
with
drunken
vagrants
sleeping
next
to
the
building
every
night
soldiers
joys
as
much
as
the
delusional
expectations
of
the
europeans
about
africa
s
potential
were
formulated
and
executed
by
europeans
so
a
parallel
industry
of
black
propaganda
contrives
to
capitalise
and
exploit
the
european
delusions
the
aim
seems
to
have
been
to
demonstrate
that
black
africans
could
compete
on
equal
terms
with
the
european
in
achievement
and
creativity
sadly
most
of
the
claims
promoted
were
fabrications
calculated
to
deceive
but
maybe
i
m
the
wrong
person
to
listen
to
as
i
have
many
problems
with
biopics
in
particular
with
those
that
attempt
to
glorify
artists
la
vie
certainly
doesn
t
shy
away
from
piaf
s
alcoholism
or
her
dependence
on
painkillers
but
nothing
is
shown
of
her
activities
during
wwii
and
only
coy
nods
are
made
at
the
rumors
of
bisexuality
the
deathbed
confession
also
irks
greatly
even
if
it
s
true
the
film
feels
like
it
is
grasping
for
unearned
tears
it
s
a
familiar
trope
with
biopics
one
that
rarely
ceases
to
bother
i
then
fall
back
on
the
couch
locals
carry
bricks
as
riots
break
out
over
inadequate
housing
and
poor
public
services
in
the
thokoza
township
of
johannesburg
sourced

i
have
learned
who
i
am
what
i
am
capable
of
and
what
my
limitations
are
i
always
strive
to
make
the
best
use
of
my
capabilities
and
to
grow
beyond

and
the
many
halal
eateries
i
love
the
fact

king
will

right
to

for
2
riyals
i
love

we
had
stopped
eating

fast
food
except
the
fillet

tuna
before
coming

i
love
it
that
i
have
so
many
choices
for
eating
halal
in
saudi
arabia
i
love
it
that
my
husband
has
created
a

for
us
where
every
thursday
morning
he
will
bring
home
parathas
fried
flat
bread
aloo
bhara
parathas
fried
flat
bread
filled
with
potatoes
and
spicy
chana
chick
peas
all
for
a
total
of
30
riyals
or
about
8
dollars
we
wouldn
t
get
that
much
food
for
8
dollars
in
the
states
a
few
months
ago
i
mentioned
that
i'd
come
into
possession
of
a
certain
tablet
device
as
part
of
a
program
through
my
school
now
that
i
have
finally
had
some
time
to
play
with
the
thing
it
is
round
about
time
to
give
some
opinion
on
the
various
toys
that
i
have
been
playing
with
i
am
admittedly
a
dinosaur
i
wrote
several
of
my
early
novels
on
a
manual
typewriter
a
heavy
all
metal
thing
that
was
called
a
portable
simply
because
it
came
with
a
case
made
of
wood
no
less
and
could
be
carried
with
one
strong
hand
it
also
was
immediate
death
to
any
kind
of

my
father
gave
it
to
me
and
for
that
i
treasure
it
and
will
never
give
it
away
though
i
doubt
that
in
these
days
i
could
depress
the
keys
i
m
too
spoiled
to
the
modern
ease
of
a
computer
keyboard
that
registers
the
slightest
touch

doesn

chip

i
got
home
and
had
to
work
with
the
kids
on
their
homework
for
a
little
bit
after
that
heather
came
home
and
we
watched
dr
phil
while
she
got
dinner
ready
we
then
sat
down
and
ate
dinner
together
after
dinner
i
went
into
the
basement
and
played
some
cod
bo
before
taking
some
more
pictures
of
lord
of
the
rings
miniatures
to
sell
on
ebay
after
working
on
that
for
about
an
hour
and
a
half
i
then
started
to
watch
some
of
my
usual
wednesday
night
shows
including
survivor
south

harry
s

and
csi
while
i
dvr
d
criminal
minds
the

and
order
svu
before
heading
to
bed
a
lot
of
the
pictures
i
take
using
instagram
are
little
things
that
i
wouldn
t
normally
take
a
picture
of
little
snapshots
of
everyday
life
and
i
love
the
vintage
effects
that
make
everything
look
that
little
bit
more
special
i
still
have
a
job
you
think
relief
floods
your
mind
that
sounds
like
something
i
can
handle
you
answer
i
m
all
salivated
up
and
ready
to
go
when
can
i
start
since
it
is
getting
a
major
overhaul
in
our
new
territory
so
when
speaks
to
us
or
about
us
he
speaks
good
words
over
us
celebrates
our
life
likes
to
do
this

the
next
day
we
were
fortunate
enough
to
be
invited
to
a
mock
interview
and
brunch
put
on
by
pageant
volunteers
and
supporters
of
the
miss
grand
forks
organization
it
is
amazing
to
see
just
how
many
dedicated
volunteers
the
miss
america
organization
has
these
people
continuously
give
their
time
and
talents
to
help
us
prepare
and
support
us
along
this
journey
i
am
always
so
thankful
for
all
the
individuals
that
have
helped
me
prepare
for
miss
nd
over
the
past
few
years
and
love
seeing
the
passion
that
we
all
share
for
the
organization
matt's
been
so
busy
with
the
nursery
that
i
have
not
been
able
to
use
him
for
a
helping
hand
but
that
is
ok
i
have
huge
plans
with
my
sewing
machine
and
some
paint
today
have
a
beautiful
blue
shimmer
released
by
milani
for
their
spring
2012
collection
milani
sail
away
is
a
medium
blue
creme
with
blue
and
silver
shimmer
almost
a
perfect
match
for
the
deep
blue
shimmer
of
the
ocean
if
y'all
are
looking
for
a
great
read
i
highly
recommend
the
violets
of
march
i
absolutely
loved
it
and
i
feel
sure
everyone
who
picks
it
up
will
fall
in
love
with
it
check
out
the
book's
trailer
below
when
it
comes
to
marketing
you
may
want
to
share
that
you
are
doing
your
part
to
be
green
in
your
business
using
a
recycle
logo
would
seem
to
be
the
easiest
way
but
did
you
know
that
they
all
mean
something
different
most
might
not
know
which
logo
is
which
but
we
ll
cover
here
what
they
look
like
and
what
they
stand
for
in
case
you
feel
it
is
important
to
your
marketing
plan
just
like
any
goulash
with
strict
country
origins
it
is
quickly
prepared
with
a
long
simmer
and
the
flavour
improves
on
the
second
day
last
year
i
fiddled
with
getting
a
traditional
czech
recipe
right
and
came
up
with
this
one
it
was
complete
with
homemade
bread
dumplings
which
i
must
say
that
while
polenta
is
a
nice
twist
nothing
pairs
with
goulash
like
dumplings
so
the
idea
that
travel
and
travail
are
linked
by
their
shared
connotation
of
work
actually
makes
a
lot
of
sense
what
is
really
intriguing
is
the
connection
to
trepalium
back
in
roman
times
this
was
a
very
specific
device
with
a
solitary
purpose
to
inflict
agony
this
is
not
like
other
metaphors
for
work
like
grindstone
or
treadmill
which
hint
at
pain
or
discomfort
as
a
side
effect
of
productivity
all
the
trepalium
produced
was
pain
and
discomfort
sometime
back
in
the
history
of
language
somebody
used
the
word
trepalium
to
suggest
that
work
was
a
form
of
torture
and
the
suggestion
was
resonant
enough
to
embed
itself
in
our
language
so
the
next
time
you
feel
like
your
office
is
really
a
gothic
torture
chamber
in
disguise
maybe
you
re
not
being
overdramatic
maybe
you
re
just
being
traditional
a
monkey
with
a
peanut
machine
luke
s
black
cows
so
i
decided
to
re
read
her
essay
because
i
know
i
can
be
i
know
i
can
let
my
personal
experience
get
the
better
of
me
when
evaluating
what
other
people
say
i
had
had
things
to
do
all
day
and
had
not
had
a
chance
to
re
read
and
i
re
read
it
and
i
decided
that
she
had
been
far
more
subtle
than
i
had
been
willing
to
give
her
credit
for
as
i
mulled
over
my
memory
of
her
essay
throughout
my
day
i
felt
grateful
to
her
for
being
willing
to
share
her
thoughts
but
i
replicated
my
thought
processes
from
earlier
today
because
i
think
it
is
important
to
acknowledge
how
touchy
and
complex
these
subjects
are
how
fearful
parents
of
disabled
children
are
of
going
public
with
any
of
these
topics
please
click
the
link
below
to
view
the
pdf
and
as
always
i'd
love
to
here
what
you
think
but
you
realize
that
the
complexity
of
the
local
architecture
especially
in
the
markets
and
casbahs
which
any
labyrinth
aficionado
would
fall
in
love
with
right
away
i
fell
in
love
right
away
is
not
only
a
kind
of
terrestrial
tactic
i
e
keeping
small
pieces
of
the
planet
sand
out
of
the
inner
rooms
it
is
also
a
philosophical
response
to
the
utterly
gigantic
north
african
landscapes
collapsing
all
over
themselves
ground
down
to
sandy
fissures
in
the
distance
you
want
to
control
space
and
limit
the
perimeter
keep
the
walls
close
i
have
been
on
school
holidays
and
spent
most
of
that
time
working
on
our
house
getting
it
all
pretty
to
sell
then
i
can
pick
out
my
next
house
in
brisbane
hopefully
outside
of
the
zombie
zoned
areas

rite
better

how
cute
is
that
i
am
certainly
no
fashion
blogger
but
i
wore
this
outfit
to
work
the
other
day
and
received
a
bunch
of
compliments
on
my
top
while
that
in
and
of
itself
it
not
noteworthy
the
the
fact
that
the
top
was
free
is
i
bought
it
with
one
of
my
nordstrom
notes
that
was
expiring
soon
if
you
also
are
a
fan
of
nordstrom
notes
here's
a
little
tip
you
can
get
gift
cards
with
them
and
those
never
expire
i
always
say
it
is
free
money
and
justin
rolls
his
eyes
and
says
oh
yeah
it
is
real
free
curious
sharia
slipped
between
the
columns
to
inspect
the
central
nave
she
found
another
rock
crystal
table
with
a
corpse
laid
atop
once
richly
dressed
and
draped
time
had
reduced
it
to
little
more
than
a
pile
of
dust
so
that
it
was
only
by
recognizing
the
silhouette
of
a
body
that
sharia
knew
it
what
it
was
two
thin
sticks
for
legs
with
knobby
lumps
where
the
knees
once
were
skeletal
fingers
clasped
upon
its
breast
and
a
grinning
skull
rising
from
the
dust
of
ages
eye
sockets
full
of
sand
toilet
paper
1
roll
per
package
well
that
is
all
i
got
today

right

i

now
so
many
years
on
when
we
have
been
drinking
my
aunt
and
i
talk
about
how
old
her
son
would
have
been

how

i
feel
dizzy
to
think
that
my

i
like
to

whether
to
believe

but
this

often
comes
to

hmmm
what

if
they
were
allowing
him
internet

why
wouldn
t
he
be
able
to
make
a
collect

call
who
did
he
talk
to
at
what
embassy
and
watched
them
i
think
he
might
draw
the
line
at
giving
you
his

i
want
to
talk
about

with

you
must
work
in
a
very
organized
way
you
have
no

with

your

could
be
very
chaotic
this
little

will
be
a
good
example

i
did
several

the

made
in
clear
imitation
of
the

usually
associated
with

he
immediately
fired

he
can
definitely
hold
his
head
up
really
well
however
he
kinda
does
not
get
tummy
time
he
just
sleeps
or
lays
there
kinda
lazy
when
it
comes
to
exercise
like
his

category
non

the
weather
was
perfectly
hot
and
the
ceremony
was
quite
amazing
and
definitely
meaningful

everyone

than

honestly
if
he
wanted
to
rest
on
his

he
would
be

you
have
finished

you

come
through
to
the

room
i
need
a
word
fuzzy
socks
thinking
i
ll
judge
her
as
the
sun
rises
they
are
exposed
how
to
move
without
arousing
suspicion
is
a
problem
since
the
workday
has
begun
and
the
suits
are
bustling
into
the
city
traffic
jamming
as
it
does
oddly
no
one
bats
an
eyelid
quirky
street
theatre
is
commonplace
and
these
players
arouse
no
suspicion
it
is
that
young
boy
i
look
for
in
the
playground
the
playground
that
is
still
there
despite
the
fact
you
need
a
key
to
get
in
now

the
hero's

to
saving
your
kingdom
separates
itself
from
the
rest
of
the
pack
thanks
to
author
christopher
healy's
clear
unique
storytelling
abilities
hero's
guide
is
crammed
with
action
adventure
excitement
and
mayhem
not
to
mention
littered
with
hilarity
the
book
features
an
omniscient
narrator
who
foreshadows
and
explains
in
a
way
sure
to
catch
a
reader's
interest
at
times
i
envisioned
the
voice
to
be
the
narrator
from
disney's
winnie
the
pooh
at
other
times
i
imagined
the
narrator
from
the
fairy
tale
musical
into
the
woods
every
chapter
heading
cleverly
begins
with
something
about
prince
charming
but
you
never
which
prince
charming
is
being
mentioned
that
is
sort
of
the
point
though
because
the
four
princes
in
hero's
guide
are
not
named
prince
charming
even
though
bards
have
demoted
them
to
such
roles
in
their
own
tales
i
have
a
foolish
heart
over
the
past
couple
of
years
i
ve
become
a
real
convert
to
eating
dandelion
leaves
and
other
bitter
plants
for
me
now
no
smoothie
would
be
complete
without
the
addition
of
a
generous
handful
of
magnificent
dandelion
leaves
the
challenge
is
to
make
a
card
or
tag
using
the
colors
i
mean
what
s
new
in
a
print
newspaper
nothing
zip
nada
except
perhaps
the
ads
it
s
really
a
flyer
not
a
newspaper
there
s
good
days
and
bad
sometimes
the
good
days
surprise
you
today
was
one
of
those
days
this
afternoon
i
had
it
setup
to
go
shoot
with
young
lcpl
from
down
the
road
i
threw
together
some
target
frames
this
week
out
of
scrap
lumber
and
had
some
cardboard
cutouts
stapled
to
them
ready
to
head
down
to
our
little
local
shooting
spot
world
of
wonders
he
shows
up
with
another
one
of
our
neighbors
so
our
merry
little
band
rolls
out
and
on
the
way
another
of
our
neighbors
is
checking
his
mail
a
quick
invite
and
our
numbers
are
now
up
to
four
in
some
ways
chua
and
the
tiger
mothers
are
taking
the
easy
route
they
have
picked
their
goal
and
are
pursuing
it
with
a
single
minded
fury
that
allows
for
no
hesitation
no
questions
no
uncertainty
no
doubts
even
as
ava
and
i
rightly
decide
to
go
the
other
way
to
value
our
time
as
a
family
over
the
pulls
of
the
childhood
industrial
complex
to
send
our
children
to
whatever
university
ava
is
currently
working
at
there
will
always
be
in
my
mind
the
tiny
what
if
the
bit
of
curiosity
about
whether
polly
or
pip
could
have
set
the
world
on
fire
had
they
been
given
the
chance
the
senate
can
also
be
held
up
as
an
example
of
do
nothing
with
the
majority
of
the
87
votes
on
only
three
bills
highway
25
postal

and

while
republicans
sneer
at
democrats
for
their
inability
to
get
anything
accomplished
however

mmmmmmmm
like

when

out
for
the

form
of
praanaayaama
as
well
as
in
some
of
the

incoherent
the
presenter
gave
us
a
lot
of
information
on
why
s
t
e
m
is
important
in
this
day
and
age
but
unfortunately
didn
t
give
us
a
lot
of
practical
ideas
for
kindergarten
s
t
e
m
units
she
demonstrated
just
two
of
them
the
first
one
was
to
have
the
children
build
a
nut
sorter
by
giving
them
a
bunch
of
common
materials
and
no
directions
at
all
and
just
let
them
go
the
participants
were
divided
into
groups
of
four
and
were
given
15
minutes
to
build
one
out
of
a
couple
of
paper
plates
masking
tape
wax
paper
paper
bags
tongue
depressor
sticks
and
index
cards
first
of
all
i
was
surprised
at
the
lack
of
sensitivity
to
nut
allergies
in
this
day
and
age
also
let
me
just
say
that
we
did
not
find
it
easy
to
make
a
nut
sorter
therefore
i
was
wondering
how
this
would
go
for
many
of
my
overly
helpless
kindergartners
whom
i
could
easily
picture
sitting
there
doing
nothing
or
insisting
that
i
tell
them
how
to
make
it
the
pessimist
in
me
would
have
liked
to
have
seen
some
photos
of
a
child
made
nut
sorter
where
an
adult
did
not
have
to
intervene
to
make
it
happen
just
to
assure
myself
that
this
project
could
actually
work
because
i
m
still
not
sure
the
other
idea
that
she
gave
us
was
to
have
the
children
design
a
candy
bar
and
a
wrapper
market
it
price
it
and
sell
it
to
their
class
mates
with
fake
money
she
brought
technology
into
the
project
by
having
them
research
chocolate
factories
on
the
internet
with
adult
help
it
sounded
like
a
lot
of
fun
but
a
lot
of
work
she
also
said
that
it
was
an
expensive
project
because
she
had
to
purchase
all
of
the
candy
making
materials
herself

enthusiasm
abounded
when
i
was
informed
that
it
would
be
taken
once
again
to

after
all
that
work
and
such
excitement
from
the
wonderful
editor
i
thought
surely
it
would
happen
now
i
did
my
job
i
was
not
too
proud
for

i
put

when
you
put

this
is
not

though
i
know
i
have
taken

i
can
not
find
it
and
it
is
a

right
now
from
making

and
i
am

to
clean

if
i
may
i
will
clear

things
up
here
lets
go
back
to
a
week
ago
from
last
wednesday
when
i
had
a
bronchoscopy
that
is
where
they
go
down
your
throat
into
your
lungs
with
a
little
camera
while
they
were
in
there
they
took
another
biopsy
of
the
tumor
tissue
in
an
effort
to
further
narrow
down
the
exact
cancer
we
are
fighting
here
bronchoscopies
are
not
fun
you
are
not
asleep
when
they
do
this
it

tom's
submission
was
brewed
by
the

brewing
club
and
was
called

the
beer
on
the
right
it
pours
a
dark
unfiltered
copper
color
with
an
1
5
inch
thick
head
it
has
a
nice
smell
including
sweet
caramel
and
crusty
bread
aromas
with
the
slightest
touch
of
citrus
hops
this
beer
is
medium
bodied
with
an
immediate
malt
sweetness
with
the
first
sip
it
really
is
super
smooth
and
drinkable
and
has
a
great
refreshing
carbonation
this
is
a
very
good
session
beer
you
could
drink
quite
a
few
of
them
something
tom
is
known
to
do
from
time
to
time
i
am
going
to
guess
it
is
about
6
abv
while
the
malt
profile
has
the
right
sweetness
the
use
of
extracts
makes
it
just
a
touch
thin
at
finish
this
is
a
really
nice
octoberfest
i
am
impressed
so
far
i
give
this

hobsbawm
s
interpretation
of
this
period
is
enlightening
and
demonstrates
his
talents
as
a
historian
however
there
are
some
faults
first
his
labeling
of
1848
as
failure
and
then
suggesting
it
fundamentally
changed
european
politics
is
contradictory
if
the
changes
created
by
1848
were
profound
and
marked
the
end
of
the
politics
of
tradition
of
the
monarchies
and
of
the
beliefs
in
patriarchal
rights
why
are
they
failures
24
the
idea
that
politics
and
society
were
different
than
before
seems
to
suggest
that
the
1848
revolutionaries
did
accomplish
a
change
in
society
the
monarchies
greatly
feared
the
revolutionary
periods
and
did
grant
some
reforms
in
order
to
placate
the
upper
echelons
of
society
and
though
little
changed
for
those
in
lower
classes
of
society
the
masses
were
now
more
politicized
than
before
revealing
that
1848
did
create
change
just
not
the
social
revolution
that
hobsbawn
desires
and
really
it
was
only
a
sort
of
argument
you
can
also
use
non
letter
characters
such
as
making

to
be
uploaded

a

that
wonderful
husband
of
mine
that
i
am
so
fond
of
mentioning
managed
to
procure
tickets
a
funny
story
that
involves
a
bar
and
a
man
in
drag
for
my
mother
and
i
to
go
see
an
advanced
screening
of
twilight
she
and
i
were
very
excited
to
see
this
movie
we
got
there
early
and
settled
down
with
plenty
of
popcorn
and
diet
coke
perhaps
a
little
too
much
diet
coke
about
15
minutes
before
the
movie
was
supposed
to
start
i
realized
that
i
needed
to
use
the
bathroom
i
hate
getting
up
in
the
middle
of
a
movie
to
use
the
bathroom
but
i
also
love
to
watch
the
previews
and
was
worried
that
i
would
miss
something
since
it
was
so
close
to
starting
time
in
the
end
i
decided
that
the
needs
of
my
bladder
were
too
great
so
i
got
up
and
flew

our

by
showing
us
a
diagram
of
a

and
explaining
its
basic
operation
a
dredge
is
a
huge
floating
shoveling
device
that
digs
out
the
ground
in

of
it
sifts
and
sorts
the
sand
and
gravel
to
sluice
out
the
gold
as
the
material
travels
through
the
dredge
on
big
conveyer
belts
the
left
over
material
was
dumped
out
the
back
end
and
left
strewn
in
huge
snake
like
wavy
piles
of
rubble

i
also
learned
valuable

about

what

to
hopefully
avoid
i
had
moved
at

when
we

i

i
had

long
graduated

actually

i
fell

days
of
finding
out
our
news
and
naturally
once
we
had
settled
ourselves
on
really
going
for

everything
happening

sometimes
i
will

moments

mild
panic
they
were
a
pack
i
have
had
for

long
time
have
you
heard
about
the
fabulousness
that

i
am
a
tad
bit
obsessed
if
you
have
not
tried
it
out
you
have
to
asap
you
will
become
obsessed
just
like
me
but
i
swear
you
will
be
thankful
on
the
site
you
can
make
mood
boards
for
home
decor
i
like
to
make
a
plan
for
a
space
before
i
begin
decorating
it
so
this
is
a
great
way
to
visualize
my
ideas
former
senator
rick
has
withdrawn
his
bid
for
the
republican
presidential
nomination
he
is
expected
to
give
his
support
to
his
good
friend
noynoy
romney
walked
to
mrs
willis
s
house
she
has
a
new
haircut
and
her
house
finally
has
lights
and
is
almost
finished
being
renovated
what
a
change
from
having
flute
lessons
with
her
two
years
ago
but
one
thing
didn
t
change
how
much
she
loves
talking
about
after
death
stuff
and
coming
back
from
the
dead
she
sent
me
off
with
these
goodies
meep
sonos
the
cadillac
of
household
streaming
digital
media
supports
all
four
of
these
services
roku
the
chevy
of
such
services
does
offer
mog
and
rdio
and
i
hope
they
offer
the
other
two
in
the
future
mog
has
also
made
plans
to
integrated
into
tvs
blu
ray
players
and
cars
what
this
will
mean
is
your
hdtv
which
people
often
connect
to
good
sound
systems
will
become
a
streaming
music
player
this
beats
the
out
of
apple
tv
as
a
music
player
just
imagine
a
tv
with
mog
and
netflix
what
a
combo
that
will
be
kissing
and
her
breast
and
rolled
on
top
of

this
year
the
fashionable
royal
continued
the
presentation
of
shamrocks
and
presented
a
basket
of
shamrocks
to
40
members
of
the
first

guards

the
military

450
soldiers
in
full
ceremonial

participated
in
the
annual
st
patrick

parade
accompanied
by
the
regimental
mascot
conmeal
an
irish
wolfhound
who
received
his
own
sprig
of
shamrock
from
the
duchess
there
was
a
sea
of
people
and
it
took
a
lot
of
pushing
to
get
through
but
this
is
what
the
main
drag
looked
like
for
several
blocks
people
were
dancing
in
the
street
playing
drums
waving
flags
hollering
etc
it
was
really
cool

just
the
fact
that
she
s
in
a
relationship
requires
everyone
to
adapt
and
rules
have
to
be
put
in
place
i
have
seen
lots
of
painting
of
this
style
on
the
web
of
late
and
it
looks
so
much
fun
so
naturally
we
had
to
try
it
out
ourselves
little
r
was
so
careful
with
the
brush
to
start
with
until
i
put
my
fingers
in
the
paint
then
she
immediately
put
the
brush
down
and
put
both
hands
in
i
wish
there
was
a
road
map
of
sorts
or
a
guidebook
or
something
else
that
gave
neat
instructions
how
to
find
and
or
build
meaningful
community
in
10
easy
steps
but
since
there
isn
t
we
re
each
left
to
figure
things
out
for
ourselves
to
find
the
paths
through
trial
and
error
that
work
best
based
on
our
own
unique
geographic
locations

the
answer
to
where
they
are
could
be
found
last
night
at
the
will
rogers
auditorium
often
at
political
events
there
is
a
sense
of
excitement
anticipation
a
certain
buzz
in
the
audience
while
waiting
for
the
main
event
excitement
anticipation
and
buzz
are
weak
and
inadequate
words
to
describe
the
pre
rally
crowd
last
night
energy
is
even
inadequate
what
undulated
through
the
thousands
who
thronged
outside
before
the
doors
opened
last
night
was
a
kinetic
power
the
power
of
hope
the
power
of
liberation
the
power
of
anger
at
a
system
turned
upside
down
the
power
of
liberation
and
yes
the
ultimate
and
emancipating
power
of
freedom
you
had
to
be
there
to
understand
it
when
black
friday
comes
i
will
be
on
that
hill
sing
you
only
spread
your
love
upon
the
walls
as
we
grew
up
of
course
our
explorations
began
to
vary
but
through
those
earlier
years
the
lessons
we
learned
have
made
adulthood
much
easier
the
tv
is
not
the
only
option
if
it
s
nice
outside
go
outside
it
s
not
where
you
re
at
it
s
who
you
re
around
you
actually
can
do
this
yourself
if
you
get
in
trouble
take
your
punishment
and
move
on
if
you
re
gonna
get
punished
make
sure
it
s
worth
it
don
t
go

it
s
never

allow
me
to
set
the
scene
i
am
a
huge
fan
of
british
comedy
in
particular
our
timeless
sitcoms
or
britcoms
as
they
seem
to
be
referred
to
these
days
whether
it
s
rowan
atkinson
s
sharp
wit
in
blackadder
or
john
cleese
s
bumbling
antics
in
fawlty
towers
our
fair
country
has
undeniably
produced
some
classics
in
its
time
so
imagine
the
excitement
i
must
have
felt
when
i
recently
heard
that
us
telly
producers
intend
to
bring
back
the
most
famous
britcom
of
all
only
fools
and
horses
for
an
american
audience

dipped

i
hope
you
had
a
wonderful
christmas
you
are
not
able
to
post
comments
on
the
articles
but
i
stumbled
across
a
blog
post
by
the
author
in
french
and
there
are
most
certainly
comments
there
and
they
are
basically
what
you
see
every
time
unschooling
gets
some
new
publicity
minus
all
the
positive
comments
by
unschoolers
jumping
in
to
tell
people
how
wrong
they
are
there
just
are
not
enough
unschoolers
in
montreal
and
no
i
did
not
look
at
the
comments
to
aggravate
myself
though
i
must
admit
it
does
feel
weird
to
have
such
venom
directed
specifically
at
us
it
does
not
bother
me
as
much
as
i
thought
it
would
but
it
is
weird
i
looked
at
the
comments
because
i
was
curious
if
the
reactions
would
be
different
than
what
i
have
seen
in
the
past
since
quebec
itself
is
pretty
different
from
the
rest
of
north
america
for
the
most
part
the
reactions
are
the
same
though
there
is
a
much
stronger
current
of
these
people
will
always
be
on
the
margins
of
society
and
will
also
be
gasp
radical
evidenced
by
the
fact
i
am
a
radical
anarchist
hippie
because
obviously
one
unschooler
represents
all
unschoolers

exploring
the

tasting
some

looking

my

but
i
did

them
this
year
unfortunately

wanted

but
its
ok
i
have
secretly
got
the
scratch

ones
hidden
in
my

after
they
go

i
am
going
to
scratch
them

they
are

until

including
to
the
sudan
he
was
imprisoned
there
in

for
helping
ethiopian
jews
reach
israel
he
has
recently
completed
a
small
town
new
england
mystery
tentatively
titled
the
nation
by
the
river
he
works
as
a
cardiac
sonographer
he
will
read
from
his
new
manuscript
a
small
town
new
england
mystery
called
the
nation
by
the
river
and
so
i
draw
my
sappy
conclusion
that
the
giant
inflatable
bounce
house
is
serving
as
one
giant
inflated
metaphor
for
me
this
week
letting
go
i
will
watch
those
little
feet
disappear
for
a
little
while
and
after
what
will
be
a
very
very
long
day
i
will
watch
him
come
back
to
me
i
will
take
a
deep
breath
and
do
it
all
over
again
apply
new
measures
the
recipe
is
actually
for
sauteed
peaches
but
we
had
over
two
pounds
thanks
costco
of
strawberries
that
were
basically
begging
to
be
used
so
i
threw
them
in
with
the
peaches
this
recipe
can
really
be
tweaked
for
individual
servings
larger
servings
whatever
you
want
but
it
is
delicious
and
ready
in
less
than
five
minutes
there
has
yet
to
be
the
definitive
titanic
movie
for
me
though
i
have
seen
many
excellent
documentaries
the
1997
movie
s
special
effects
were
good
however
with
so
many
rich
colorful
and
true
stories
of
the
actual
people
who
sailed
on
titanic
i
felt
that
this
movie
was
a
wasted
effort
in
its
made
up
storyline
a
sampling
of
some
of
the
intrigue
that
was
real
life
drama
on
titanic
ink
cajun
craze
early
espresso
yesterday
was
not
quite
that
interesting
for
me
but
had
increasing
levels
of
unexpectedness
my
blog
yesterday
morning
was
titled
guess
the
name
of
the
comedian
and
the
clue
was
that
the
un
named
comic
does
just
sometimes
use
prostitutes
mostly
in
soho
interestingly
two
other
comedians
suggested
the
self
same
name
to
me
but
they
were
wrong
this
other
now
famous
tv
comic
whom
they
named
clearly
needs
to
do
something
about
his
image
among
his
peers
i
hate
saying
that
employees
of
the
botswana
society
for
the
deaf
say
the
deadline
for
them
to
be
paid
their
wages
for
march
and
april
has
come
and
gone
without
any
relief
for
them

i
couldn

what
was

but
i
could
feel
it
in
fact
i
was
left

by
it
i
decided
at
the

of
the

that
i
had
to
let
go
temporarily

my

for
the

science
just

of
refereeing
decisions
but
on
this
occasion
he
was
willing
to
make
an
exception
that
is
just
dumb
he
said
shaking
his
head
in
reaction
to
his
younger
brother's
yellow
card
having
conceded
a
free
kick
on
the
half
way
line
i
attempted
to
prevent
any
initiative
durley
hoped
to
gain
from
a
quickly
taken
set
piece
by
gently
kicking
the
ball
away
towards
our
goal
dan
allen
had
other
ideas
at
only
seventeen
he
is
still
a
little
wet
behind
the
ears
he
got
in
my
way
giving
the
ball
straight
back
to
durley
that
is
your
fault
dan
shouted
manager
paul
in
reference
to
sam's
booking
his
voice
loud
as
a
klaxon
managed
to
convey
a
sense
of
injustice
at
all
times
dan's
naivety
drew
sam
hewitt
into
the
evasive
action
although
his
intention
was
no
different
from
mine
his
execution
was
weighty
sending
the
ball
too
far
away
and
therefore
rendering
his
strategy
to
slow
things
down
obvious
to
all
and
sundry
that
my
greatest
assets
were
acts
of
cynicism
and
gamesmanship
said
all
that
was
needed
about
my
contribution
to
the
team
unlike
dan
allen
i
have
had
plenty
of
practice
to
hone
my
craft
soon
followed
an
unbasting
session
is
that
a
word
and
now
it
is
all
quilted
and
soft
and
gorgeous
life
doesn
t
work
like
that
wherever
we
are
today
is
the
result
of
a
lifetime
of
choices
you
know
that
eating
a
packet
of
donuts
today
will
not
cause
you
to
be
5kg
heavier
on
the
scales
tomorrow
however
making
a
habit
of
those
donuts
will
eventually
show
up
on
the
scales
therefore
you
can
lie
to
yourself
and
say
see
those
donuts
made
no
difference
i
can
do
it
again
why
not
turn
that
right
around
start
saying
see
that
run
made
no
difference
i
can
do
it
again
using
the
exact
logic
that
got
you
into
unhealthy
lifestyle
choices
to
get
you
out
i
found
these
little
plastic
raisers
for
painting
furniture
at
ace
hardware
recently
i
thought
they
were
a
pretty
genius
but
simple
idea
they
just
lift
whatever
you
are
painting
slightly
off
the
ground
or
whatever
your
surface
is
so
that
you
do
not
get
the
sticking
that
you
do
when
you
paint
pieces
laying
on
the
floor
or
a
dropcloth
also
the
point
of
the
triangle
makes
a
minimal
mark
so
you
can
go
ahead
and
turn
your
piece
over
and
paint
it
pretty
quickly
and
you
just
have
a
teensy
little
dot
to
touch
up
later
if
you
want
this
was
the
first
time
i'd
tried
them
and
they
were
great
not
only
does
jesus
come
down
from
heaven
live
without
sin
dies
for
our
sin
rises
as
our
saviour
ascends
into
heaven
and
he
opens
a
doorway
into
the
presence
of
and
the
kingdom
of
and
invites
us
to
come
through
it
by
trusting
in
him
jesus
is
exclusive
not
all
religions
save
not
all
paths
lead
to
eternal
life
not
all
religions
are
true
there
is
no
salvation
and
no
forgiveness
of
sins
no
reconciliation
with
apart
from
faith
in
jesus
christ
jesus
is
exclusive
and
inclusive
he
invites
us
all
no
matter
what
sin
you
ve
committed
jesus
invites
you
no
matter
what
race
you
are
jesus
invites
you
no
matter
how
old
you
are
jesus
invites
you
no
matter
what
you
ve
believed
up
to
now
jesus
invites
you
the
door
is
open
one
door
his
name
is
jesus
christ
everyone
is
welcome
to
pass
through
that
door
all
nations
all
genders
all
ages
all
peoples
satan
of
course
wanted
to
foil
gods
plan
christ
could
not
pay
for
the
sins
of
mankind
if
he
sinned
himself
so
satan
s
first
plan
of
attack
was
to
tempt
trick
and
torment
jesus
into
sin
jesus
stood
firm
and
did
not
sin
with
time
growing
short
satan
realized
that
his
only
option
left
was
to
the
son
of
and
by
killing
him
having
victory
over
christ
and
s
plan
for
mankind
surprisingly
this
blog
has
reached
one
hundred
posts
i
hope
that
sharing
what
has
been
on
my
plate
has
added
some
pop
sparkle
and
imagination
to
your
own
i
know
that
some
faithful
have
tried
a
few
recipes
a
few
devoted
have
made
comments
although
i
once
read
a
statistic
that
the
average
blog
reader
never
leaves
comments
i
am
glad
to
know
that
i
am
sharing
with
people
who
are
not
just
average
some
persuasive
friends
hound
me
when
i
do
not
post
and
some
even
demand
a
mention
now
and
again
here
you

street
hawker
food
can
be
the

food
but
visitors
fear
the
conditions
might
not
be
hygienic
actually
such
places
are
probably
more
reliable
that
five
star
restaurants
since
everyone
sees
everything
the
cook
does
and
tv
brings
it
all
in
our
living
rooms
i
think
this
is
one
where
you
can
blame
the
media
we
shouldn
t
be
exposed
to
anything
these
people
say
but
here
it
is
the
new
ipad
with
a
resolutionary
screen
and
a
faster
processor
is
a
great
product
an
amazing
tablet
for
everyone
those
who
don
t
have
it
yet
are
praising
it
the
most
but
those
who
have
it
are
reporting
problems
its
been
a
week
since
apple
launched
its
new
ipad
and
users
are
reporting
overheating
problems
yes
the
ipad
overheats
but
not
only
that
there
is
another
issue
with
this
beautiful
looking
tablet
see
i
am
praising
it
which
means
i
don
t
have
it
and

that

i
have
often
wondered
how
things
would

out
for
me
had
i
actually
gotten
what
i
had
specifically
wished
for
being
released
on

of
being

would

relief
and
excitement
that
s
for
sure
and
i
saw
it
on
the
faces
of
the
other
lucky
four
but
these
would
have
been
for
an
extremely
short
time
at
least
for
me
in
reality
there
was
practically
nothing
left
for
me
then
and
this
much
vaunted
and
desired
freedom
was
limited
to
just
all
those
desires
mentioned

lauren
says
i
play
a

named
rhea
whose
a
very
talented
and
determined
dancer
but
dancing
for
all
the
wrong
reasons
throughout
the
film
she
breaks
free
from
the
pressures
of
what
everyone
else
wants
and
expects
from
her
and
finds
her
own
passion
and
love
of
dance
along
the
way
her
teachers
and
fellow
dancers
help
guide
her
through
this
transformation
instead
of
being
repulsed
by
the
self
destructive
behaviour
of
others
ask
them
how
can

we

what
is
your
best
organizational
tip
the
day
after
i
arrived
one
week
after
these
family
arrangements
my
host
sister
mother
and
i
went
to
khemisset
for
the
weekend
where
rashid
lives
for
the
official
engagement
party
it
was
similar
to
the
one
i
experienced
in
my
training
site
with
my
first
host
family
many
extended
family
members
were
there
from
both
sides
for
the
first
couple
of
hours
all
the
women
sat
downstairs
drinking
tea
eating
snacks
and
chatting
while
the
men
sat
upstairs
engagement
arrangements
were
made
and
once
finalized
my
host
aunts
yelled
out
their
high
pitched
ceremonial
screams
and
everyone
came
to
congratulate
my
host
sister
singing
clapping
dancing
and
music
followed
an
elaborate
dinner
was
served
genders
still
separated
and
once
everyone
had
stuffed
themselves
full
of
delicious
food
the
women
went
upstairs
to
join
the
men
fatima
zahra
came
up
last
and
saw
her
finance
for
the
second
time
ever
they
awkwardly
sat
together
on
one
couch
staring
down
at
the
floor
away
from
each
other
while
gifts
were
presented
to
them
such
as
clothing
candy
and
sugar
henna
was
put
all
over
my
host
sister
s
hands
and
feet
rashid
s
mother
then
passed
a
huge
of
cash
to
my
host
uncle
who
stood
in
as
the
head
man
of
the
family
since
my
host
father
was
away
at
work
across
the
country
he
counted
the
money
aloud
4
000

equal
to
about

because
i
am

companies
i
was
waiting
for
the
final
closure
bill
from
my
old
energy
provider
with
some
dread
i
thought
i
might
be
owing
them
all
sorts
of
money
because
it
had
just
been
wintertime
and
an
expensive
time
of
the
year
that
bill
came
in
the
mail
today
and
much
to
my
relief
i
am
getting
a
nice
amount
of
money
back
that
i
can
really
use

i

to

i
do
love
the
snow
i
do
not
drive
in
it
so
i
have
no
reason
to
not
like
it
i
just
look
out
the
window
and
see
how
pretty
it
is
in
my
subdivision
it
is
all
going
to
melt
away
over
the
next
few
days
though
because
it
is
going
to
be
warm
you
know
like
35
degrees
instead
of
2
like
it
is
been
the
past
couple
of
weeks
i
guess
we
will
take
what
we
can
get
during
the
winter
i
follow
his
blog
and
i
found
this
post
particularly
worthwhile
to
writers
everywhere
and
it
wasn
t
just
because
of
the
everest
simile
though
that
was
the
sealer
for
me
it
wasn
t
until
just
now
that
i
suddenly
realized
where
the
monkeys
could
have
possibly
gone
i
need
to
look
into
it
more
but
we
may
finally
be
able
to
leave
windows
open
from
time
to
time
shiva

hey
the
song
continues
equally
as

are

currently

the

living

squalid
concrete
construction
are
given
the
opportunity
to
describe
and
explain
their
hardship
many
of
them
of
course
were
present
throughout
the
years
of
the
lebanon
conflict
it
is
here
that
the
before
and
after
structure
of
the
film
gives
each
retelling
of
events
a
deeply
emotional
core
it
s
one
thing
to
see
a
man
lose
his
son
to
war
but
to
witness
how
it
has
affected
him
25
years
on
is
something
even
more
tragic
i
had
stopped
believing
that
democracy
is
the
exercise
of
power
was
for
malaysia
is
good
because
it
is
the
benefit
of
his
people
in
their
struggle
for
meaning
if
this
bill
seems
too
idealistic
reality
hit
me
hard
and
when
i
found
out
quickly
as
completed
the
rally
the
t
won
speculate
a
lot
about
the
causes
of
the
chaos
happens
except
to
say
that
among
the
theories
of
provocation
and
saboteurs
were
not
favor
able
no
doubt
the
act
violently
bersih
many
friends
of
my
outraged
that
our
contribution
through
the
absurdity
of
these

that

when

in

we
do
not
need
democracy
because
we
are
good

because
they
have
fallen

the
dilution
of
the
imperfect

in

thing
that

this
is
why
getting

the
vast

of

in

is
instigated

men
not

violence

can
only
say
that
i
wish
there
were
more
of
it
this

desperately
needs
one
good
ananias

a
moment
when
s
wrath
is
clearly
and
unmistakably
shown
to
mankind
of
course
i
don
t
want
to
be
the
victim
and
i
don
t
wish
that
sort
of
victimhood
on
anyone
in
particular
however
i
do
ask
myself
from
time
to
time
why
hugh
hefner
has
been
allowed

his

wouldn
t

if
had
wiped
out

and

long

in
a
dramatic
display
of
divine
judgment
we
americans
are
suffering
from
a
lack
of
clearly
divine
retribution
not
too
much
of
it
the
so
called
wicked
of
the
bible
is
more
merciful
than
any
of
us
and
we
ought
to
thank
him
for
it

me

yesterday
seen
me
a
lil
nervous
as
i
had
a
interview
for
my
job
application
at
the
school
for
a
permanent
position
i
received
fabulous
news
this
afternoon
that
i
have
been
successful
in
obtaining
the
position
so
i
am
over
the
moon
there
was
something
more
something
about
those
days
at
the
texas
state
fair
i
mean
to
tell
you
all
i
can
tell
you
my
friend
is
that
during
all
those
years
that
we
went
to
the
state
fair
of
texas
i
cain
t
ever
remember
running
into
a
come
now
come
now
come
now
but
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth
we
never
thought
about
it
where
we
lived
we
never
saw
a
black
face
so
when
we
went
to
the
fair
we
didn
t
think
about
it
when
we
didn
t
see
a
black
face
except
for
a
few
that
worked
there
i
kaint
believe
i
remember
a
single
time
while
a
black
man
sang
on
the
radio
which
was
broadcast
over
loudspeakers
face
it
head
on
they
had
their
day
at
the
fair
we
had
all
the
rest
of
the
days
and
there
was
somethin
to
the
idea
day
at
the
state
fair
day
was
no
different
than
the
rest
of
the
days
at
fair
except
it
was
for
no
embarrassing
situations
that
way
and
with
signs
tellin
em
where
they
could
go
and
where
they
couldn
t
there
could
be
no
mistakes
you
hardly
expected
white
people
to
drink
out
of
the
same
water
fountains
or
use
the
same
toilets
would
you
take
lucky
s
take
on
it
the
first
thing
was
it
took
most
of
the
worry
out
of
it
with
you
don
t
want
no
trouble
second
someday
and
someday
and
someday
someday
it
may
be
all
different
but
at
that
time
there
was
the
way
they
lived
and
the
way
we
lived
and
it
was
totally
different
the
truth
was
you
had
to
keep
off
the
ride
and
laff
in
there
amongst
creepy
rats
snakes
and
a
vulture
we
screamed
and
laughed
frightened
by
a
real
live
sparrow
that
somehow
got
loose
now
we
didn
t
want
no
trouble
no
point
crying
over
spilled
milk

says
as
he
strokes
her

and
fills
her

understanding
maybe
it
is
a
problem
with
me
maybe
i
have
no
soul
but
i
don
t
hate

i
ve
had
pets
i
ve
watched
them
lick
their
and
i
ve
cleaned
up
their
period
from
the
lino
oooh
she
s
in
season
how
adorable
and
called
them
a
when
they
ve
farted
on
me
and
i
ve
thought
to
myself
that
they
have
got
a
pretty
good
deal
if
i
could
in
the
garden
and
get
away
with
it
i
would
if
i
could
in
the
back
of
someone
s
car
and
have
everyone
in
stitches
then
i
would

for

even
inside

all
of
your
posts
if
i
have
not
made
it
to
your
blog
yet
it
will
happen
i

a
few
juicy
snippets
from

accounts
of

publica
the
think
tank
set
up
by
the
portly
protagonist
phillip
blond
in
the
glory
days
of
the
tory
election
campaign
blond
you
may
recall
was
doling
out
large
dollops
of
economic
and
social
advice
to
david
cameron
big
society
locality

moral

virtuous
elites

popular

this
year
an
image
has
been
forming
insistently
in
my
mind
whenever
i
am
sitting
at
the
ancestor
altar
michelle
obama
thinks
it
is
her
business
you
are
fat
and
we
need
a
national
health
program
and
they
just
tried
to
ban
kids
working
on
family
farms
if
ever
you
are
in
red
river
new
mexico
and
are
hiking
alone
in
the
woods
keep
an
eye
out
you
never
know
who
or
what
may
be
lurking
around
the
next
corner
when
he
realised
she
was
soon
going
to
float
beyond
his
sight
he
leaped
at
last
only
back
up
not
towards
freedom
there
were
some
great
characters
in
this
book
anna
was
awesome
and
i
found
it
really
strange
that
i
was
rooting
for
a
mass
murderer
but
it
was
all
about
the
way
she
was
written
she
was
flawed
but
she
was
real
the
story
behind
her
really
got
to
me
that
scene
was
incredibly
intense
by
the
way
i
was
upset
i
have
this
thing
about
realistic
violence
i
do
not
like
to
read
about
it
i
do
not
watch
movies
with
it
in
it
and
if
i
had
known
about
it
beforehand
i
would
have
prepared
myself
but
i
got
through
it
business
can
also
establish
credibility
integrity
and
a
degree
of
trustworthiness
merely
by
interacting
with
a
niche
portion
of
the
population
on
line
obviously
it
needs
to
be
in
a
positive
and
helpful
manner
which
will
help
yield
the
results
that
companies
are
striving
for
nonetheless
a
companies
approach
is
generally
dependant
on
their
particular
organizational
mantra
and
overall
goal
structure
in
the
wake
of
a
tragic
boating
accident
that
killed
her
friends
16
year
old
miranda
is
consumed
by
guilt
she
has
no
memory
of
how
she
managed
to
survive
the
crash
only
the
murky
dreams
of
a
strange
boy
in
the
dark
water
her
only
refuge
is
in
the
late
night
swims
she
takes
alone
until
one
night
on
the
beach
when
she
meets
christian
a
boy
who
seems
eerily
familiar
but
keeps
many
secrets
i
was
a
little
unsure
of
what
to
make
with
leather
i
have
never
worked
with
it
before
then
i
saw
my
sharp
crochet
hook
and
ding
i
thought
i'd
try
crocheting
through
leather
and
what
do
ya
know
it
worked
i
am
loving
how
this
cuff
came
out
and
hope
you
do
too
here
is
a
really

any
regiment
ending
its

in
contact
with
an

regiment
is
by
definition
charging
regiments
can
only
charge
enemies
that
are
in
its
los
at
the
start
of
their
activation
charge
contact
can
only
be
made
with
the
front
side
of
the
charging
regiment
s
base
against
one
of
the
target
s
sides
any
side
just
not
a
corner
neither
the
rear
nor
sides
nor
any
corner
of
the
charger
can
be
used
to
contact
an
enemy
regiment
a
regiment
must
stop
at
least
1cm
away
from
an
enemy
if
it
cannot
charge
it
it
is
perfectly
normal
to
pivot
after
moving
in

with

the

to
seem
like
being

in

it
can
be
significantly
more
thoughtful
and
in

you
would
have
spent
braving
the
toy
store
and
your
own
child's
inevitable
desire
to
get
something
for

while
you
are
there
you
can
sit
down
with
your

and
spend
some
time
thinking
about
her

maintain
the

that
would
enable
you

you

then
you
are
already

if
you
are

you
might
say
i
ve
overdone
it
but
i
ve
sent
those
two

snow

hitmen
yeti
cool
brothers
so
i
think
i
had
an
evening
that
qualifies
as
one
of
the
really
bad
ones
last
night
busy
with
the
day
s
work
okay
so
we
didn
t
go
to
scotland
but
we
went
to
a
scottish
festival
i
know
that
travel
will
more
than
likely
be
limited
to
the
good
old
usa
for
my
kids
so
taking
advantage
of
heritage
festivals
might
be
as

as
they

only

people
once
i
have
started

when
i
am
coming
up
with
storylines
i
do
not
talk
to
anyone
else
i
want
them
to
be
purely
from
my
own
mind
other
people
are
good
for
editing
purposes
but
i
do
not
let
them
near
the
stories
themselves
i
believe
ranking
sites
like
klout

twitter
and
pinclout
for
pinterest
only
add
fuel
to
the
fire
i
will
admit
that
i
checked
my
klout
score
after
hearing
of
it
and
it
was
a
little
disheartening
for
those
studying
or
practicing
social
media
a
low
klout
score
can
yield
a
negative
effect
everyone
wants
to
make
an
impact
but
maybe
we
should
focus
on
who

once
we
recognize
that
davis
at
some
early
stage
was
evidently
sympathetic
to
rolly's
offbeat
interior
design
we
may
be
able
to
go
back
and
visualize
at
least
a
little
bit
what
the
stretching
gallery
masterpiece
might
have
looked
like
yale
built
a
half
inch
scale
model
of
the
elongating
room
and
suggested
to
rolly
that
he
design
the
stretching
portraits
rolly
did
produce
some
sketches
but
later
on
marc
was
not
satisfied
with
them
and
replaced
them
with
his
own
despite
that
loss
i
think
that
davis's
beautiful
concept
artwork
may
give
us
a
hint
of
what
might
have
been
it
is
certainly
weirder
than
what
we
ended
up
with
in
fact
if
you
ask
me
the
one
item
in
the
sketch
that
looks
slightly
out
of
place
is
the
davis
portrait
is
that
because
the
essentials
of
this
design
came
from
elsewhere
to
deleuze
the
plain
of
immanence
is
something
that
must
be
actively
constructed
and
does
not
per
exist
it
is
something
that
can
emerge
through
the
on
going
development
on
multiple
bodies
without
organs
or
in
other
words
bodies
such
as
art
politics
and
science
that
have
unlimited
potential
for
expansion
development
and
exploration
it
is
through
their
overlapping
and
co
existence
that
would
create
what
deleuze
refers
to
as
a
multiplicity
of
immanence
deleuze
and
guitarri

whether
the
bodies
are
the
correct
ones
if
a
correct
one
even
exists
is
irrelevant
as

in
in
the
very
beginning
of

accomplished

over

my
life
has
changed
significantly
from
that
hot
west
texas
afternoon
i
left
the
ranch
and
saw
the
world
i
became
a
successful
researcher
executive
and
entrepreneur
on
this
journey
i
faced
many
trials
and
challenges
challenges
problems
and
crisis
that
would
terrify
you
that
would
make
you
give
up
all
hope
and
that
would
rob
you
of
your
joy
invariably
when
faced
with
such
challenges
with
such
great
fears
i
would
always
go
back
to
the
day
of
that
barbeque
and
remember
that
snake
i
can
be
one
of
those
 
fluffy
gamers
 
does
not
mean
i
i
do
not
sometimes
stumble
into
a
powerful
army
build
or
combination
i
do
not
want
to
like
things
i
just
tend
to
by
nature
to
clarify
i
do
not
think
they
are
but
the
more
competitive
of
gamers
out
there
might
pose
questions
about
the
teams
forces
and
armies
i
gravitate
toward
with
why
not
take
x
or
beta
would
be
a
lot
more
effective
than
your
gamma
etc
but
these
suggestions
invariably
break
the
theme
the
fluff
or
the
sheer
goofiness
of
what
i
have
in
mind
and
i
am
left
wondering
how
they
could
suggest
these
changes
like
people
who
want
to
put
mushrooms
on
pizza
i
know
it
is
common
but
it
is
just
so
wrong
and
let's
not
even
approach
the
taste
bud
imbalance
required
to
want
pineapple
or
bbq
sauce
on
pizza
or
corn
do
you
know
that
it
is
common
to
put
corn
on
pizza
in
belarus
to
be
fair
though
i
do
not
think
anything
called
pizza
there
should
count
as
pizza
other
than
the
home
made
pizzas
i
made
there
ok
this
is
going
off
topic
as
pizza
will
tend
to
impose
my

to

metabolism
is
the
sum
of
all
the
chemical
reactions
that
occur
in
a
living
cell
in
order
to
provide
energy
for
the
organism
to
do
important
things
like
breathing
digest
food
sleep
etc
there
are
two
ways
that
these
reactions
can
occur
okay
i
promise
not
to
stay
away
so
long
this
time
did
i
make
it
up
with
all
my
love
projects
sort
of
anyway
hopefully
some
of
these
techniques
help
and
if
you
guys
have
questions
feel
free
to
leave
them
in

them

i

am
wondering

there
aren

any
yoga
teachers
pounding
down

door
to
ask
to
teach
beginners
at
my

perhaps
they
do

value
of
this
perhaps
i
don
t
understand
the

enough

before
the

and
the
forenoon
of

next
day
when
jesus
was
nailed
to

every
one

was
broken
our

was

our

not
inherently

because
of
the

owen
wilson

inez
rachel
mcadams
have
accompanied
her
parents
to

the

up
their
differences

most
prickly
manner
she
is
all
about

for
expensive
items
while

wants
to
take
midnight
walks
in

indeed
he
loves
paris
so
much
he
wants

an
idea
she
rejects

crazy

she

if

for
all
the

get
tired
of
this
italian
chandelier
i
have
in
my
dinette
i
loved
trent's
score
for
the
social
network
last
year
by
the
way
i
should
mention
that
he
works
on
his
scores
with
atticus
ross
they
are
also
bandmates
in
how
to
destroy
angels
but
dragon
is
on
a
whole
other
level
i
have
not
read
the
book
but
when
i
do
i
will
be
playing
the
score
it
really
adds
to
the
film
and
is
almost
its
own
character
for
those
of
you
interested
in
would
you
read
it
or
simply

the
most
inspired
portrait
ever
done
of
cleopatra
is
the
one
painted
in
1888
by
j
w
waterhouse
i
am
going
through
a
bit
of
a
waterhouse
phase
and
have
blogged
about
his
fabulous
paintings
of
adonis
ariadne
circe

narcissus
and
orpheus
waterhouse
was
famous
for
painting

we
have
had
a
number
of
health
issues
in
our
home
mostly
the
normal
childhood
illnesses
danielle
was
a
very
healthy
baby
and
toddler
she
did
not
even
get
a
cold
until
after
she
was
a
year
old
as
a
preschooler
she
dealt
with
a
few
bouts
of
reactive
airway
disease
syndrome
and
now
as
a
teen
has
occasional
sinus
trouble
but
over
all
is
fairly
healthy
emily
was
just
the
opposite
her
food
allergies
and
asthma
brought
us
quite
a
few
sleepless
worried
nights
she
also
gave
us
a
scare
with
an
inconclusive
cystic
fibrosis
test
that
lead
to
more
tests
which
neither
confirmed
nor
ruled
out
cf
that
was
nearly
10
years
ago
and
since
she
is
never
exhibited
any
symptoms
other
than
the
ones
that
prompted
the
test
in
the
first
place
we
have
all
but
forgotten
about
the
abnormal
test
results
derek's
respiration
trouble
as
a
toddler
preschooler
likely
stemmed
from
the
rsv
he
contracted
at
two
months
he
has
a
few
other
issues
but
i
am
going
to
touch
more
on
that
in
another
post
last
is
my
anna
who
like
danielle
is
a
pretty
healthy
kid
we
did
have
one
big
scare
with
her
too
back
when
she
was
still
nestled
in
my
because
i
was
the
ripe
old
age
of
35
my
ob
deemed
me
an
older
expectant
mother
and
sent
me
to
the
hospital
for
a
special
ultrasound
that
she
could
not
do
in
her
office
the
radiologist
first
pointed
out
that
my
baby
was
a
girl
and
then
told
us
that
he
found
a
cyst
in
her
brain
i
think
that
i
was
supposed
to
be
afraid
at
that
point
but
i
simply
refused
to
believe
that
there
was
anything
wrong
with
my
baby
not
even
when
he
mentioned
the
scary
term
trisomy
18
and
gave
us
a
very
brief
description
of
what
that
was
then
he
zoomed
in
on
her
little
hand
which
was
stretched
open
and
explained
that
children
with
trisomy
18
do
the
opposite
they
clench
their
hands
that
was
all
i
needed
i
refused
the
ammio
for
personal
reasons
and
instead
opted
to
go
back
for
another
ultra
sound
several
weeks
later
by
then
the

this
particular
instance
may
not
be
of
much
significance
the
oaksterdam
university
has
stated
that
it
will
re
open
immediately
but
it
drives
home
the
very
real
message
that
cannabis
is
still
illegal
in
the
usa
and
its
governmental
approval
will
not
be
gained
through
the
guise
of
a
taxable
business
however
much
this
ought
to
be
rewarded
in
a
capitalist
society
it
seems
therefore
that
the
war
on
drugs
is
far
from
reaching
an
end
and
the
absurd
contradiction
between
federal
and
state
law
is
still
causing
problems
for
patients
and
businesses
alike

i
have
chosen
to
write
about
it
in
hopes
that
it
may
help
some
of
you
and
bring
you
to
an
awareness
of
a
condition
some
of
you
may
be
experiencing

i
suppose
there
is
a
rock
scene
just
a
few
cities
over
i
guess
there
are
stars
on
the
streets
downtown
there
are
maybe
some
important
modernist
buildings
just
sitting
around
including
the
wright
in
need
of
restoration
and
maybe
even
a
few
eames
there
s
a
nara
and
some
chihuly
and
a
couple
other
beautiful
things
i
d
like
to
steal
in
the
city
museum
and
i
guess
the
statues
of
of
sonny
bono
and
lucille
ball
mean
that
they
lived
here
at
a
time
what
do
you
do
when
you
have
hurt
someone
and
cant
change
things
how
to
use
the
magical
led
dance
floors
in
which
i
dream
intensely
fun
pastime
for
trying
to
understand
the
homobigoted
perspective
step
1
find
at
least
one
video
involving
same
intimacy
as
suit
your
comfort
level
even
just
a
clip
of
mitchell
and
cameron
modern
family
kissing
will
do
fine
step
2
find
a
similar
number
of
videos
from
movies
depicting
catastrophic
disasters
things
like
2012
or
the
day
after
tomorrow
are
ideal
step
3
watch
all
of
the
videos
in
alternating
order
one
from
the
first
group
followed
by
one
of
the
terrible
repercussions
depicted
in
the
second
group
for
bonus
subtext
follow
a
kiss
with
the
bit
from
return
of
the
king
when
sauron
s
giant
mighty
tower
fractures
and
explodes
step
4
realise
with
growing
horror
that
some
people
may
actually
believe
that
this
is
a
legitimate
concern
step
5
realise
with
even
more
horror
that
there
are
definitely
people
with
serious
sociopolitical
power
who
want
you
to
believe
this
is
a
legitimate
concern
because
it
will
keep
you
distracted
while
they
steal
everything
you
own
and
sometimes
they
are
succeeding
the
more
people
do
this
the
more
radically

changes
says
gary
wolf
one
of
the
movement
s
spokespeople
i
find
that
the
most
interesting
tools
are
those
that
give
us
the
chance
to
reflect
on
who
we
are
i
m
currently
dreaming
of
a
dining
room
makeover
and
saving
up
to
buy
flooring
wainscoting
paint
furniture
and
accessories
for
the
room
you
know
just
everything
the
room
is
sadly
empty
right
now
i
have
been
thinking
a
lot
about
water
lately
after
rereading
the
mistborn
series
and
the
different
ways
that
metals
were
used
to
create
three
different
and
distinct
magic
systems
that
are
similar
i
was
thinking
about
the
different
ways
in
which
water
could
be
used
to
create
power
as
water
wheels
turning
gears
a
very
rudimentary
way
of
getting
things
done
as
steam
power
which
is
more
sophisticated
but
has
the
drawbacks
of
needing
water
to
turn
into
steam
and
then
as
hydroelectric
power
i
am
still
figuring
out
how
i
would
use
these
three
elements
of
water
in
my
world
but
this
is
a
start
we
ll
see
where
it
goes
from
here
and
all
along
the
pathways
echoing
between
the
trees
i
do
not
go
to
many
yard
sales
i
liked
to
go
when
the
kids
were
young
and
gas
was
not
so
high
i
enjoyed
looking
for
bargain
clothing
for
them
when
they
were
little
and
not
so
picky
about
what
they
wore
and
got
outdoors
however
there
was
an
ad
in
our
local
paper
that
caught
my
eye
this
weekend
in
the
midst
of
all
the
goodies
listed
were
the
words
stamping
up
hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
i
decided
the
weather
was
great
so
it
might
be
worth
a
drive
early
the
next
morning
i
had
a
few
errands
i
could
do
while
out
anyway
it
actually
is
square
but
yet
again
i
am
a
horrible
camera
holder
it
now
has
the
binding
on
it
applied
by
machine
baaaahahahahahaaaaad
lisa
and
it
is
hanging
over
my
thread
racks
in
the
studio
shattered
seems
like
a
good
name
for
it

early

it
was
ok
i
got
up
and
made
myself
some
coffee
i
sat
here
on
the
couch
and
was
soon
followed
by
my
10
year
old
son
then

i
then
took
my
coffee
my
kindle
and
went
back
to
bed
the
image
is
coloured
with
distress
inks
i
had
to
make
a
mix
of
colours
to
make
the
perfect
colour
for
the
dress
i
think
i
did
it
pretty
well
i
repeat
archaeology
is
one
of
the
most
important
fields
for
the
understanding
of
ourselves
and
better
yet
the
betterment
of
ourselves
so
that
we
may
have
better
and
brighter
futures
i
know
i
got
a
lot
of
exercise
the
last
few
years
just
getting
over
the
hill

if
i
knew
beforehand
i
wouldn

have

she
makes
me

all
the

it
is
not

she
is
trying
to
be
funny
she
is
just
at
such
a
fun
age
where
she
is
learning
and
exploring
and
developing
her
personality
exponentially
every
day
she
is
starting
to
walk
more
on
her
own
still
every
time
she
stands
on
her
own
she
lets
out
this
tarzan
esque
triumphant
yell
to
alert
us
to
her
accomplishment
she
is
learning
to
nod
and
shake
her
head
appropriately
yesterday
she
was
hitting
the
glass
tv
stand
with
something
and
i
said
elizabeth
no
and
shook
my
head
she
looked
over
her
shoulder
at
me
grinned
and
awkwardly
nodded
yes
twice
and
then
continued
to
hit
the
stand
it
was
way
too
cute
i
went
and
took
her
weapon
away
all
the
while
laughing
and
telling
her
how
cute
she
was
mixed

not
at
all
the
federals
opened
fire
on
the

with

this
bombardment
lasted
for
several
day
but
caused

damage

autry
was
killed
in

on
dec

1862
and
his
body
was
returned
to
his
home
in
holly
springs
i
thought
i
would
share
the
card
anyway
since
its
done
and
my
eldest
says
i
should
embrace
my
off
days
too
which
is
proof
positive
of
her
affinity
for
fortune
cookies
going
back
to
my
cashier's
job
however
has
made
me
feel
totally
worthless
maybe
it
is
because
the
writer
i
was
working
for
one
afternoon
a
week
is
off
researching
a
book
so
there
is
nothing
cultural
to
balance
out
my
week
it
might
also
be
because
i
recently
saw
a
friend
who
did
a
similar
masters
to
mine
in
the
states
publish
an
article
in
preparation
for
a

this
is

of
your

books
on

it
is
a
serious
look
at
the

by
two

an
assistant
professor
of
philosophy
at
west
virginia
university
and
a
professor
of
moral
psychology
at
macquarie
university
in
sydney
australia
together
they
explore
the
strong
connection
between
fashion
and
the
aesthetic
of
an
era
the
difference
between
the
servile
and
sensible
fashionista
the
politics
of
individual
style
and
fashion
choices
and
much
more
it
is
a
book
for

it

was
not
disappointed
him
i
thought
i
was
the
last
von
niederhoffentanger
when
coming
up
with
awesome
cool
sf
tech
of
the
future
it
s
tempting
to
start
by
looking
at
all
the
cool
things
that
exist
now
and
then
extrapolating
them
out
to
their
logical
conclusions
in
the
future
we
ll
have
the
internet
on
steroids
and
screens
in
your
contact
lenses
and
everyone
will
have
a
rocket
pack
robots
will
do
everything
virtual
keyboards
hover
cars
as
to
what
can
be
performed
and
shown
there
are
no
guidelines
the
idea
is
that
if
something
comes
up
that
is
offensive
to
someone
that
we
all
be
open
to
discussing
it
mostly
we
want
to
encourage
all
types
of
artistic
expression
the
next
event
is
in
june
to
find
out
more
look
us
up
on
facebook
and
find
the
group
stage
2
develop
a
wordless
book
based
on
the
born
to
fly
storyline
and
distribute
it
to
kids
worldwide
why
wordless
so
we
don
t
have
to
translate
it
into
hundreds
of
languages
saving
thousands
of
hours
and
dollars
i
had
considered
for
quite
a
long
time
finding
a
skilled
physical
therapist
to
address
the
pelvic
floor
issues
but
for
various
reasons
felt
that
i
was
not
sure
about
the
effectiveness
in
regards
to
the
cost
i
wanted
to
learn
more
before
i
made
that
investment
i
walk
by
my
dad
who
is
surrounded
by
other
fathers
of
irish
building
stock
their
thick
arms
and
tanned
body
s
lent
over
the
static
tea
and
sandwiches
shift
your
focus
off
of
self
condemnation
when
our
conscience
relentlessly
condemns
us
remember
that
christ
will
have
the
last
word
he
is
judge
of
the
living
and
the
dead
1
peter
4
5
and
only
he
can
pronounce
the
final
sentence
christ
is
the
judge
not
us
or
our
conscience
so
never
for
a
moment
dare
to
take
the
judge
s
place
by
proclaiming
irreparable
guilt
when
he
proclaims
hope
grace
and
pardon
if
we
think
our
sin
is
too
great
to
be
pardoned
remember
that
christ
doesn
t
agree
sincerely
but
i
hope
sometime
someplace
conceding
the
plausibility
of
this
is
not
it
also
true
that
no
total
exception
exists
no
decision
made
in
a
vacuum
of
institutional
legal
order
could
be
in
any
way
effective
there
is
a
lot
of
law
below
the
level
of
the
constitution
or
even
statutory
law
army
and
police
codes
and
rules
about
chain
of
command
quite
significantly
that
need
to
be
depended
on
especially
in
a
state
of
exception
so
the
decision
itself
always
requires
a
residue
of
the
norm
to
be
put
into
effect
since
moreover
the
cooperation
of
these
institutions
is
also
a
matter
of
decisions
made
in
the
chain
of
command
this
also
shows
that
the
decision
is
not
unitary
and
all
this
is
to
say
nothing
of
the
place
of
informal
norms
about
the
conduct
in
politics
which
do
much
to
determine
the
actual
paths
of
events
in
cases
where
the
law
is
not
explicit
what
exactly
about
paragraphs
and
reasoning
did
you
not
understand
and
i
would
be
happy
to
clarify
it
for
you
finally
i
had
a
wonderful
dinner
at
one
of
my
favorite
restaurants
furin
in
delray
a
perfect
way
to
top
a
perfect
day
i
really
don
t
understand
people
who
plan
each
day
months
in
advance
ok
sometimes
i
guess
it
might
be
good
but
most
of
the
time
lol
no
we
never
know
what
is
to
happen
why
plan
and
be
disappointed
or
maybe
it
just
me
i
like
more
like
loving
living
my
day
each
day
as
it
comes
i
never
know
what
i
am
going
to
do
so
when
i
do
something
its
fun
and
i
am
happy
doing
it
i
honestly
don
t
think
i
would
be
to
happy
having
my
days
plan
out
in
advance
would

the
next

you

of

think
about
the

it

may

the
thing
wants
you
to
hear
today
one
simple
way
that
the
church
can
reach
out
to
the
community
around
it
is
by
using
these
signs
to
share

message
what
does
your

say
will
it
make
a
difference
in

today
in

i
love
to
write
i
have
written
a
children
s
book
and
am
still
proofing
a
book
i
started
3
years
ago
this
post
will
present
articles
excerpted
text
noting
documenting
this
recognition
as
made
by
an
eclectic
range
of
personalities
from
journalists
authors
to
professors
i
am
doing
plenty
but
are
they
worthy
enough
to
enumerate
cooking
cleaning
grocery
shopping
running
errands
laundering
and
most
importantly
i
am
making
myself
available
to
get
my
kids
off
the
bus
and
asking
that
important
question
how
was
school
today
guys
and
then
lending
a
patient
ear
this
was
more
of
an
indoor
outfit
anyways
with
it
is
skirt
that
twisted
around
when
i
walked
it
is
warm
but
not
wind
proof
sweater
and
it
is
exposed
ankles
the
leggings
are
the
only
thing
i
would
have
changed
but
since
my
quest
for
tights
has
been
entirely
unsuccessfully
i
am
stuck
with
exposed
ankles
if
i
had
the
opportunity
to
live
in
only
peace
i
d
take
it
or
i
would
have
before
i
knew
christ
but
now
that
i
know
him
i
know
something
i
never
imagined
who
is
love
and
therefore
has
a
natural
ease
to
be
joyful
all
the
time
took
the
sorrow
of
the
cross
to
die
for
our
sins
he
didn
t
have
to
do
that
but
he
came
down
to
our
world
of
mixed
up
messes
and
all
the
gray
we
complain
is
between
the
black
white
because
that
is
who
i
am

you

you

you

you

been

very
much

i
so
enjoyed

they

there
s
a
reason
this
film
won
the
golden
bear
at
the
berlin
film
festival
and
was
such
a
critical
favorite
but
sadly
there
s
also
a
reason
that
this
film
didn
t
find
more
acclaim
with
mainstream
audiences
i
will
avoid
the
general
cynicism
that
is
so
often
used
when
discussing
american
audiences
and
just
say
that
i
think
if
people
viewed
this
not
as
a
foreign
film
not
as
something
snobbish
or
elitist
or
difficult
they
would
enjoy
it
so
often
we
find
ourselves
settling
for
pure
entertainment
that
we
forget
what
it
means
to
go
to
the
movies
we
forget
how
transcendent
how
personal
how
moving
films
like
this
can
be
this
film
contains
an
emotional
depth
that
is
little
seen
in
american
cinema
as
of
late
and
it
is
an
emotional
depth
i
think
is
needed
in
our
lives
yes
this
film
may
be
emotionally
challenging

it

so
last
night's
lesson
was
the
start
of
trying
to
put
oliver
on
the
bit
and
keeping
him
there
we
have
reached
the
stage
in
our
training
that
he
knows
what
to
do
but
i
needed
to
finally
figure
a
few
things
out
before
we
could
progress
i
am
getting
to
help
with
some
of
the
event
planning
for
day
of
caring
and
the
palooza
kickoff
celebration
on
september
10th
and
11th
which
i
love
if
you
go
went
to
unl
day
of
caring
is
basically
like
the
big
event
except
city
county
wide
if
you
live
in
greeley
then
you
should
sign
up
to
help
out
go
to
united
way
of
weld
county
and
click
on
day
of
caring
and
come
celebrate
with
us
on
friday
9
10
in
lincoln
park
we
will
be
having
all
sorts
of
food
fun
and
information
about
weld
county
non
profits
and
the
united
way
the
idea
of
course
is
that
if
you
are
not
constantly
background
checking
you
are
a
sap
in
this
world
view
which
i
worry
is
spreading
like
a
fungus
everyone
is
evil
until
proven
otherwise
that
is
not
only
wrong
it
leads
to
the
breakdown
of
community
i
look
out
for
you
you
look
out
for
me
that
actually
makes
us
safer
the
world
is
too
much
with
us
late
and
soon
my
other
goals
here
at
omf
have
always
been
about
motivating
and
inspiring
women
to
organize
this
blog
is
a
resource
for
you
as
well
you
can
always
go
down
to
my
search
bar
on
the
lower
right
side
of
my
side
bar
on
the
blog
and
type
in
a
search
word
of
something
you
are
wanting
to
organize
you
know
like
closets
kitchen
or
kids
and
lots
of
great
place
to
start
and
i
have
lots
of
content
there
well
i
hope
that
this
year
you
will
be
even
more
inspired
and
there
is
so
much
i
have
planned
for
you
to
help
achieve
that
registering
is
free
and
easy
and
should
not
take
you
more
than
5
minutes
to
complete
it
is
really
easy
you
just
need
to
supply
basic
information
about
yourself
so
that
we
can
register
you
and
begin
sending
you
surveys
if
guys
wear
girl
would
you
make
them
peeing
you
can
not
find
many
places
that
sell
these
bottles
they
say
we
visited
one
pub
that
does
but
allegedly
you
have
to
take
your
empties
back
if
you
want
some
more
meaning
it
is
very
difficult
to
get
onto
the
bathams
ladder
in
the
first
place
i
thought
so
each
tiny
indignant
property
rights
advocate
seriously
though
when
you
go
overly
with
the
pledge
or
pam
for
that
matter
and
get
some
on
the
floor
by
mistake
it
takes
years
for
the
floor
not
to
be
slippery
anymore
it
is
a
death
trap
for
anyone
wearing
socks
suddenly
you
have
small
zones
of
floor
all
around
your
house
marked
off
with
cones
that
you
know
to
be
careful
around
like

a

overall
the

seemed

tuesday

was
an

i
watched
henri

phantom
of
the
cinematheque
seven's
for
30
at
tjmaxx
score
although
i
have
this
odd
feeling
they
are
not
real
sevens
but
i
honestly
do
not
care
because
they
were
soooo
comfortable
when
i
tried
them
on
that
is
my
robbie
roo
pushed
out
the
good
old
fashioned
way

you

that
the

and
i
feared
at
all
i
simply
as
per
usual
hear
the
words
in
my
head
as
my
eyes
focus
on
a
spot
within
the
mirror
later
and
i
will
type
those
words
out
maybe
in
the
morning
they
will
make
no
sense
at
all
and
nobody
else
will
see
them
who
cares
i
ve
did
my
bit
i
have
just
returned
from
a
two
day
stay
on
an
island
called
koh
samet
located
about
half
way
between
my
current
residence
and
the
cambodian
border
i
had
been
to
koh
samet
a
few
years
previously
and
that
trip
proved
to
be
one
of
those
life
altering
events
bringing
with
it
a
lot
of
pain
and
changing
my
expectations
about
the
rest
of
my
life
but
that
is
another
story
for
another
time
and
place
as
mentioned
in
a
previous
post
you
are
sleeping
all
by
yourself
now
this
is
bittersweet
for
mommy
as
i
miss
snuggling
with
you
at
night
but
the
amount
of
rest
that
i
am
getting
is
unreal
you
are
such
a
good
sleeper
you
have
been
going
to
bed
at
8
30pm
and
waking
at
9
00am
sometimes
in
the
morning
i
watch
you
lay
in
bed
and
play
with
your
baby
doll
before
i
go
in
and
get
you
it
is
too
sweet
finally
shirley
is
able
to
stab
him
to
death
or
at
least
leave
a
prop
knife
hanging
off
his
belt
according
to
the
looks
of
this
then
makes
it
to
the
bathroom
as
two
cops
arrive
on
the
scene
uh
how
did
they
know
to
come
here
did
some
unseen
neighbor
call
them
do
they
have
esp
and
why
are
not
they
even
in
uniform
maybe
they
are
plainclothes
but
i
did
not
even
see
any
badges
with
them
just
guns
maybe
they
are

we
know
that
the
fifth
fleet
in
bahrain
patrols
the
borders
between
iran
and
bahrain
bahrain
is
a
strategic
point
and
important
to
the
us
we
also
know
that
the
eu
and
us
have
been
pushing
iran
to
allow
the
international
atomic
energy
agency
iaea
to
do
a
follow
up
on
iran
to
gather
evidence
that
iran
has
its
nuclear
plant
to
provide
nuclear
energy
without
building
nuclear
weapons
every
time
this
question
is
brought
up
iran
doesnt
care
about
what
the
international
community
thinks
it
reached
a
point
where
in
late
february
2012
israel
made
it
clear
that
the
program
is
on
going
and
iran
is
still
building
nuclear
weapons
the
eu
are
asking
the
un
to
continue
to
put
pressure
on
iran
to
the
point
where
the
us
put
sactions
on
iran
to
force
them
to
stop
their
nuclear
program
so
far
the
us
is
a
big
enemy
to
iran
and
vice
versa
it
seems
like
the
us
didnt
intend
to
hand
iraq
over
to
the
persians
to
control
but
this
is
the
part
that
really
the
latest
release
of
wikileaks
gi
files
that
consists
of
5
million
emails
is
quite
scary
to
even
read
and
here
s
why
again
canberra
sources
tell
me
that
just
last
month
tamil
spokespersons
had
told
the
national
security
research
centre
that
they
would
mount
a
protest
if
the
centre
did
not
invite
gordon
weiss
to
be
a
speaker
at
a
conference
entitled
safeguarding
australia
sadly
i
do
not
actually
have
any
of
these
magazines
as
far
as
i
remember
i
never
saw
them
on
any
of
the
local
newsstands
when
i
was
a
kid
although
the
color
comic
was
not
hard
to
find
i
have
hunted
for
them
in
various
back
issue
bins
over
the
years
but
never
came
across
any
copies
i
have
poked
around
online
too
but
never
found
any
that
i
felt
were
reasonably
priced

favorite
chinese
restaurant
in
the

my
impression
and
feelings
about
the
concert
were
mixed
the
music
gave
a
definitely
yiddish
impression
the
most

were
the

i

with

on
sunday
we
left
the
frills
behind
and
headed
off
to

alfie

went
to
cosy
up
with
the
grandparents
in
his
new
cone
of
shame
poor
boy
keeps
chewing
his
hip
until
it
bleeds
so
he
needed
a
lampshade
to
sort
him
out
he
seems
fine
with
it
on
and
best
of
all
it
means
he
can
not
lick
his
feet
which
he
does
literally
all
day
it
drives
me
insane
that
gulpy
wet
lickety
spit
noise
all
i
needed
to
buy
was
a
4
bottle
of
apple
cider
vinegar
and
we
are
in
business
i
funneled
the
vinegar
into
the
other
bottle
and
it
works
perfect
as
a
squeeze
bottle
the
first
time
i
tried
this
logan
was
shocked
at
having
something
squirted
into
his
ear
with
such
volume
and
speed
he
shook
his
head
back
and
forth
and
ear
wax
actually
flew
out
in
mass
amounts
so
it
was
definitely
successful
in
breaking
it
up
if
your
dog
doesn
t
like
the
idea
of
squirting
you
may
want
to
assign
a
wash
cloth
just
for
him
and
apply
the
solution
to
the
cloth
before
working
it
in
with
that

while
until

good
luck
everyone
as
such
the
actual

speech
has
largely
become
a

event
missing

were

i

i
plumped
for
a
pint
of
the
italian
birra
moretti
and
chose
the
gamberoni
aurora
as
my
starter
king
prawns
baked
in
garlic
fresh
herbs
cream
and
napoli
sauce
topped
with
mozzarella
and
then
baked
in
an
oven
the
birra
moretti
had
an
instant
dryness
to
it
but
had
very
little
malt
flavour
which
resulted
in
a
rather
light
offering
once
my
starter
arrived
a
nicely
presented
fanned
casserole
dish
with
5
large
king
prawns
sat
in
the
middle
of
the
garlic
and
herb
cream
sauce
with
the
lightly
baked
mozzarella
layered
on
top
a
unique
idea
that
i
ve
never
come
across
before
i
thought
it
made
a
change
to
the
usual
prawn
cocktail
perfectly
cooked
the
king
prawns
were
piping
hot
with
the
sauce
a
great
compliment
that
didn
t
look
greasy
or
burnt
around
the
edges
to
think
it
was
only
a
few
decades
ago
that
people
were
allowed
to
have
four
five
or
six
children
if
it
weren
t
for
the
old
pictures
i
wouldn
t
have
believed
it
my
friend
marie
tells
me
her
mom
was
one
of
ten
ten
that
s
just
so
gross
i
ve
heard
there
are
still
some
large
families
in
existence
but
thanks
to
the
new
child
tax
those
overpopulating
kooks
will
be
taxed
out
of
existence
soon
of
course
if
they
want
to
continue
violating
the
laws
they
can
pay
their
fines
that
s
fine
with
me

which
is

i
now
accept
that
i
am
are
routinely
accused
of
hating
different
cultures
and
wishing
to
destroy
them
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
truth
we
are
the
ones
who
passionately
want
to
see
different
cultures
preserved
however
our
crime
is
that
we
also
want
to
preserve
our
own
unique
and
beautiful
culture
i
love
arsenal
and
my
throat
is
sore
from
singing
loudly
all

though
not
everyone
was
as
vocal
but
it
s
a
love
hate
relationship
i
have
a
prince
who
is
also
chauffeur
and
chef
anyway
he
is
outraged
that
israel
considered
the
flotilla
a
provocation
really
where
did
they
get
that
idea
from
is
it
because
there
is
no
humanitarian
crisis
in
gaza

even

there

it

two

before

he
is

thanksgiving
day
proved
to
be
a
bit
eventful
bf's
parents
were
hosting
dinner
at
their
house
and
planned
to
start
cooking
around
7
00
am
to
have
the
food
on
the
table
by
3
00
pm
bright
and
early
on
thanksgiving
morning
the
toilet
in
their
basement
powder
room
exploded
ie
ceramic
bowl
completely
shattered
spewing
water
everywhere
since
that
bathroom
is
never
used
there
was
no
real
mess
other
than
the
six
inches
of
water
that
had
spread
throughout
their
entire
finished
basement
luckily
they
have
a
wet
dry
vac
and
were
able
to
remove
most
of
the
water
within
a
few
hours
of
the
explosion
but
it
certainly
created
quite
a
disruption
between
their
basement
toilet
the
flooding
in
my
prior
apartment
and
a
recent
roof
leak
in
my
new
apartment
i
have
never
before
been
so
convinced
of
the
force
of
water
ok
this
is
just
plain
old
common
sense
no
political
agendas
for
either
side
just
common
knowledge
for
citizens
of
a
country
especially
american
citizens
who
know
every
little
tidbit
about
every
other
president
and
their
wives
that
even
know
that
andrew
jackson's
wife
smoked
a
corn
cob
pipe
and
was
accused
of
adultery
or
that
lincoln
never
went
to
school
or
kennedy
wore
a
back
brace
or
truman
played
the
piano
by
the
end
of
that
speech
all
the
crowds
had
left
and
only
twelve
men
remained
jesus
apparently
wasn
t
interested
in
marketing
himself
to
the
masses
his
invitations
to
potential
followers
were
clearly
more
costly
than
the
crowds
were
ready
to
accept
and
he
seemed
to
be
okay
with
that
he
focused
instead
on
the
few
who
believed
him
when
he
said
radical
things
and
through
their
radical
obedience
to
him
he
turned
the
course
of
history
in
a
new
direction
a
posting
by
pm
lee
this
morning
comparing
germany
to
singapore
brought
a
torrent
of
criticisms
from
singaporeans
who
pointed
out
that
the
comparison
is
inappropriate
this
case
became
big
news
in
the
japanese
media
back
then
because
it
s
considered
normal
behavior
that
someone
who
gets
caught
up
in
a
heated
possibly
drunken
argument
and
hopefully
unintentionally
causes
injury
or
worse
to
another
person
would
confess
to
the
police
and
apologize
to
the
family

the

it
for

when
i

i
kept
it
simple
a
few
words
about
my
past
job
in
a
psychiatric
hospital
a
passing
nod
to
my
education
which
turned
out
to
be
quite
relevant

the

wanted

in

look

if
you

this
gave
me
a
clean
picture
of
the
texture
of

and
easily
defined
the
bright

but
it
was
too
clean
i
mean
this
thing
should
be
and
not
just
mud
it

should
look

i
and
i
had
we
were
deciding
a
name
for
the
band
and
for
some
strange
reason
wanted
to
have
a
long
name
this
is
what
came
out
no
backstory
or
whatever
just
simple
as
that
for
a
major
reflection
is
just
too
extreme
criticism
of
the
current
university
model
should
not
be
taken
as
a
ringing
endorsement
for
the
digital
university
i
will
post
some
suggestions
for
higher
ed
reform
later
this
week
however
online
course
providers
like
udacity
and
coursera
offers
a
glimpse
into
a
possible
future
for
higher
education
this
is
a
future
in
which
a
bachelor
s
degree
decreases
in
economic
value
and
course
certification
become
the
new
must
have
qualification
this
may
sound
far
fetched
the
bachelor
s
is
now
an
absolute
requirement
for
high
level
entry
into
the
knowledge
economy
especially
since
such
a
system
threatens
the
aristocratic
grip
that
america
s
top
universities
have
had
on
higher
education
for
over
one
hundred
years
but
unless
these
schools
adapt
and
many
of
them
already
are
doing
so
they
will
witness
their
decline
and
the
triumph
of
the
new
digital
paradigm
write
up
your
results
inside
the
house
she
and
her
husband
once
shared
one
of
my
favorite
things
just
chilling
out
i
have
come
to
love
these
times
they
were
not
very
frequent
in
the
past
due
to
long
working
hours
and
now
i
enjoy
the
opportunity
when
it
comes
around
and
i
m
left
to
wake
to
get
another
grey
glare
i
love
honour
and
respect
the
christ
consciousness
yes
i
know
i
should
have
had
my
arm
checked
out
sooner
but
at
this
time
my
husband
was
going
through
some
pretty
serious
health
issues
himself
and
it
did
not
seem
the
right
time
to
be
out
of
commission
myself
i
also
kept
hoping
it
would
just
get
better
on
its
own
into
the
words
lord
weidenfeld
hoped
that
the
new
chair
along
with
another
that
was
established
last
year
at
oxford
university
would
be
the
first
in
a
network
around
the
country
which
furthers
stereotypes
more
to
discuss
the
ideas
that
summers
put
forward
or
to
assume
that
young
women
are
so
fragile
that
they
cannot
even
hear
alternative
viewpoints
to
assume
that
they
cannot
differentiate
between
someone
saying
that
women
as
a
whole
are
less
likely
to
be
well
suited
for
scientific
careers
and
someone
saying
that
they
individually
are
not
cut
out
for
it

as
a
chronic
alcoholic
and
there
is
nothing
more
he
could
do
the
doctor
delivered
my
baby
via
c
section
and
he
was
expert
and
wonderful
and
my
daughter
was
healthy
and
beautiful
and
safe
when
i
returned
for
my
check
up
weeks
later
they
told
me
that
my
midwife
s
breast
cancer
had
returned
and
she
was
starting
treatments
again
invite
him
to
your
party
actually
he
is
there
anyway
so
you
might
as
well
make
a
conscious
invitation
it
might
make
a
difference
in
how
you
and
your
other
guests
respond
be
conscious
of
his
presence
in
all
you
do
this
is
two
pages
that
i
print
back
to
back
cut
down
to
size
and
then
fold
it
backwards
so
the
title
is
on
the
front

you
are

uma
s
greyhound
buddy
polly
pocket
was
there
they
had
fun
catching
up
at
least
i
assume
they
did
definition
of
opprobrium
anyway
here's
what
we
have
got
running
when
they
had
massive
evidence
of
black
on
white
leftwing
racism
they
did
nothing
weakness
nearly
40
percent
of
vcu
s
field
goal
attempts
are
three
pointers
that
s
a
lot
the
rams
live
by
the
three
and
die
by
the
three
that
s
a
dangerous
way
to
live
it
worked
very
well
for
them
in
the
tournament
last
year
but
that
was
last
year
this
is
a
new
group
with
an
unrealistic
set
of
expectations
i
m
not
sure
history
will
repeat
itself
coexistence
and
peace
is
possible
the
only
thing
we
need
is
to
want
it
and
accept
it
a
few
days
in
i
finished
the
notebook
i
started
when
i
began
the
course
and
had
to
start
writing
in
a
new
one
the
new
notebook
is
also
a4
paper
but
the
lines
are
a
lot
closer
together
so
there
are
far
more
lines
and
thus
far
more
writing
is
required
in
order
to
fill
3
pages
worth
i
m
fine
with
this
it
feels
right
to
be
intensifying
the
process
round
about
now
i
was
getting
too
comfortable
with
the
old
way
i
see
s
face
enjoy
your
time
on
clear
lake
you
are
great
at
leaving
and
sending
notes
to
your
grandma
and
grandpa
there
so
when
you
re
wondering
if
you
should
send
one
more
you
ll
find
these
in
the
cupboards
of
their
home
tucked
here
and
there
after
they
die
and
it
will
sustain
you
for
years
thereafter
write
the
notes
send
the
cards
metaphorically
speaking
of
course
the
douglas
pennant
family
who
still
own
a
40m
painting
by
rembrandt
in
penrhyn
castle
bangor
had
large
run
sugar
plantations
in

they
made

are
quite
old
dcwv
and
my

is
a

and
the
cute
little

was
given
me
to
play
with
by
this
weeks
fabulouso

thanks

and

meanwhile
oblivious
to
the
scandal
najib
has
already
moved
onto
to
his
next

he
is
now
trying
to
be
mr
cool
malaysians
have
already
received
a
taste
of
this
revamped
image
with
najib
spouting
words
like
awesome
cool
and
inviting
youths
to
his
official
residence
to
watch
the
recent
football
finals
sure
there
are
punitive
elements
to
probation
and
one
always
hope
for
self
betterment
in
prison
but
from
the
stand
point
of
the
prosecutor
those
seem
to
be
the
basics
i'd
thought
of
adding
community
safety
to
the
prison
category
but
if
rehabilitation
is
achieved
then
probation
gets
us
there
too
for
a
more
detailed
discussion
of
probation
and
its
goals
look
at
last
week's
post
here
but
by
undervaluing
the
punitive
elements
to
probation
i
think
prosecutors
like
mark
may
come
to
over
rely
on
prison
when
they
think
there
has
to
be
some
punishment
it
doesn
t
really
matter
what
type
of
music
they
have
played

dad
i
have
seen
what
must
be
like
when
we
assaulted
this
compound
there
were
fathers
bringing
up
their
dead
babies
to
me
and
shoving
them
into
my
arms
for
help
and
then
the
moment
passed
and
of
course
by
the
next
day
those
i
encountered
were
the
same
irritating
rude
people
they
always
are
and
so
was
i
i
did
not
see
the
presence
of
in
the
people
i
encountered
and
now
halfway
through
lent
i
catch
myself
even
forgetting
to
look
of
course
as
the
mom
of
two
boys
i
did
not
have
any
tutus
around
the
house
i
stopped
at
target
and
picked
up
two
tutu
size
10
girls
the
largest
they
had
it
fit
me
like
a

is

right
beside

i

were
clambering
onto

rock
to
take
pictures
that
was

more
risky
than

no

when
you

it
that
day
you
have
to

says
also
you
can
make

with

it
is
no
coincidence
that
nick
glibb

are
new

and
want
to

for

uk
education
is
as
i
have
said
before
a
political
football
which
is
always
being
kicked
around
as
in
need
of
reform
it
never
seems
to
occur
to
people
like
glibb
and
rosen
that
things
might
improve
if
there
were
less
shake
ups
and
schools
could
get
on
with
teaching
but
having
wallowed
in
a
bit
of
strictly
non
substance
related
nostalgia
i
have
come
to
a
conclusion
one
song
that
for
me
at
least
has
strong
links
to
that
time
is
from
none
of
the
bands
so
far
mentioned
but
from
those
mod
rockers
the
who
of
course
the
song
in
question
is
i
can
see
for
miles
released
in
the
relevant
window
of
late
1967
it
sees
the
who
on
the
rise
to
their
creative
peak
probably
around
1969
70
and
uses
so
much
studio
enhanced
ingenuity
and
complicated
harmonies
that
like
many
of
its
contemporaries
it
was
impossible
to
reproduce
live
without
it
sounding
a
tad
on
the
thin
side
nothing
in
the
trayvon
martin
case
passes
the
smell
test
which
is
not
to
say
that
trayvon
deserved
to
die
or
that
zimmerman
was
or
was
not
justified
in
the
shooting
the
problem
is
that
the
media
has
spoon
fed
and
misinformed
they
edited
a
tape
on
msnbc
to
make
zimmerman
appear
to
be
focusing
on
trayvons
race
they
still
continue
to
post
trayvons
photo
from
several
years
passed
a
smiling
young
boy
from
the
past
not
the
6ft
plus
young
black
man
who
tweeted
under
the
moniker
of
no
limit
you
can
make
this
roast
stuffed
or
not
i
have
never
made
it
not
stuffed
but
i
imagine
it
would
be
sort
of
like
a
big
slab
of
seitan
if
you
did
it
that
way
not
that
this
is
a
bad
thing
necessarily
but
for
me
i
think
part
of
what
is
great
about
is
that
it
does
not
seem
so
heavy
with
the
stuffing
in
the
middle
and
it
is
not
nearly
as
scary
for
any
non
veg
ns
you
might
be
eating
with
if
you
are
not
going
to
stuff
this
you
can
just
put
it
in
a
loaf
pan
to
bake
if
you
want
it
to
retain
its
shape
otherwise
you
can
just
form
it
a
loaf
shape
and
put
it
in
a
baking
pan
like
you
will
do
with
the
stuffed
one
he
said
the
process
would
take
about
a
month
and
described
some
of
the
symptoms
given
that
he
later
said
that
many
others
would
also
be
going
through
it
i
ll
quote
what
he
says
about
them
but
i
request
that
you
hear
it
as
applicable
to
you
as
well
this
picture
holds
so
much
inspiration
for
me
i
can
just
see
myself
and
a
dear
friend
sitting
in
a
beautiful
room
catching
up
on
our
lives
to
create
my
card
i
used
the
papertrey
ink
set
simply
jane
i
wanted
to
capture
the
design
and
colors
of
the
area
rug
and
i
thought
the
simply
jane
frame
would
be
perfect
i
sponged
the
die
cut
frame
with
latte
pigment
ink
from
a
muse
studio
next
i
stamped
the
matching
ornate
frame
image
using
crumb
cake
ink
from
stampin
up
in
the
picture
there
are
very
light
touches
of
pink
dark
and
light
and
i
think
i
captured
that
in
my
floral
bouquet
with
the
matching
stamped
bow
i
used
two
shades
of
pink
from
a
muse
studio
bubblegum
and
shell
the
delicate
color
shading
was
created
using
an
eye
shadow
applicator
love
how
that
turned
out
i
used
the
pti
linen
canvas
impression
plate
to
add
subtle
texture
to
the
back
ground
i
love
the
way
my
card
turned
out
and
i
kinda
hope
you
like
it
to
0
have
a
wonderful
day
and
i
think
that
is
about
it
quiet
doings
are
good
doings
i
decided
with
one
week
left
that
it
was
not
the
end
of
the
world
after
all
i
could
warn
other
travelers
by
writing
an
honest
review
of
our
experience
but
that
was
not
the
case
because
regardless
of
the
evidence
in
videos
texts
and
pictures
we
sent
to
airbnb
by
their
request
it
now
seems
like
they
have
taken
the
hosts
side
and
removed
our
negative
review
i
would
remind
you
that
my
partner
has
given
you
messages
in
the
past
about
the
attitude
of
physics
now
we
are
right
back
to
the
polarity
discussion
that
started
this
channelling
this
attitude
yawee
is
imbued
into
the
natural
invention
that
you
have
discovered
physics
is
active
and
seeks
balance
that
is
to
say
that
every
field
you
have
created
with
your
process
has
the
attributes
are
you
ready
of
perfect
dna
it
already
sees
the
attributes
of
the
blueprint
of
the
unborn
you
don
t
need
a
pregnant
woman
the
attributes
can
be
passed
to
the
human
and
received
by
that
human
in
whatever
posture
that
his
cellular
structure
is
able
to
absorb
non
hodkin
s
lymphoma
a
type
of
blood
cancer
which
has
been
associated
with
farming
in
dozens
of
studies
is
also
on
the
rise
in
the
general
population
the
incidence
of
non
hodgkin
lymphoma
has
almost
doubled
since
1970
very
few
cancers
are
on
the
increase
to
that
extent
according
to
dr
roy
williams
of
pinnacle
health
medical
oncology
associates
in
harrisburg
the
fact
that
non
hodkin
s
lymphoma
is
increasing
in
the
general
population
is
concerning
yet
it
has
been
a
big
problem
in
the
agricultural
community
for
a
long
time
when
a
team
of
scientists
at
the
medical
college
of
ohio
looked
at
studies
published
in
the
last
15
years
they
concluded
that
farmers
have
an
elevated
risk
of
the
cancer
non
hodgkin
s
lymphoma
likely
due
to
their
exposure
to
infectious
microorganisms
herbicides
and
insecticides
because
of
lack
of
data
about
farmworkers
data
about
farmers
is
often
used
in
place
since
both
groups
are
likely
exposed
to
the
same
pesticides
ohhh
it
is
wednesday
night
again
well
that
means
i
michele
f
am
here
to
share
with
you
the
winners
for
our
last

challenge
you
are
all
winners
in
my
book
but
that
would
be
too
easy
so
here
is
your
winner
and
2
honorable
mentions
again
thanks
so
much
for
sticking
it
out
with
us
from
week
to
week
i
m
just
thrilled
we
got
him
back
i
was
scared
to
death
there
were
a
lot
of
teams
out
there
that
had
money

i
was
scared
to
death
some
team
was
going
to
throw
this
offer
at
us
11
million
a
year
or
something
like
that
that
could
of
dramatically
changed
the
way
we
build
this
franchise
part
of
the
influence
of
heavily
serialised
shows
like
mad
men
has
been
to
render
any
show
that
engages
in
procedural
elements
dumbed
down
lumping
everything
in
with
the
csi
mould
of
case
of
the
week
and
glacial
false
character
development
when
an
episode
deems
it
necessary
but
to
discard
every
piece
of
procedural
drama
as
being
such
is
to
do
a
dis
service
to
shows
like
er
homicide
life
on
the
street
and
even
buffy
though
that
was
more
monster
of
the
week
you
might
as
well
discard
the
twilight
zone
if
you
believe
that
a
new
story
in
each
episode
represents
a
betrayal
of

this
is
a

for

them

they
must

completely
revise
their
legal
systems
and
establish
rules
that
apply
to
all
foreign
investors
and
importers
without
discrimination
whatever
all
i
know
now
is
that
this
season
was
just
another
wasted
36
hours
of
my
life
that
i
won
t
get
back
is
it
just
me
or
did
it
feel
like
it
dragged
on
forever
thank
for
dvr
so
i
could
fast
forward
through
the
commercials
and
mondo
himself
why
did
i
even
come
back
to
watch

everyone

was
in

mouth
for
this

granted
austin
scarlet
is
always
entertaining
and
original
but
why
did
he
have
to
waste
his
time
on
this
dreck
of
a
show
kenley
still
hasn
t
figured
out
how
to
talk
without
chewing
her
face
but
at
least
she
s
a
designer
i
can
see
appealing
to
a
realistic
customer
base
when
she
isn
t
throwing
cats
at
her
boyfriend
they
should
have
just
kept
looking
for
investors
instead
of
taking
time
out
of
their
lives
for
the
producers
to
milk
them
for
publicity
and
then
toss
them
aside
for

c
thanks
for
nothing
at
least
i
now
have
more
reason
to
continue
to
ignore
the
regular
season
of
pr
especially
since
that
tv
land
fanatic
with
the
oompa

tan
will
be
returning
shame
on
you
congress
but
here
is
where
she

if

were

i
hope

i
have
enjoyed
staying
at
home
on
a
friday
night
looking
at
my
facebook
photos
and
videos
of
the
past
i
thank
for
whatever
and
whoever
that
comes
right
into
my
life
and
has
made
an
impact
on
me
but
of
course
nothing
is
smooth
sailing
in
one
s
life
if
it
is
always
smooth
sailing
it
just
meant
that
the
rocky
storm
hasn
t
come
yet
not
that
i
am
trying
to
meant
it
the
hard
way
it
just
shows
how
blessed
we
are
when
is
forever
there
during
all
the
rocky
moments
and
i
believe
when
we
have
our
smooth
sailing
moments
its
him
that
see
us
through
that
is
also
a
fantastic
song
by
the

from
the

maddy's
the
one
girl
in
angel
city
who
does
not
breathlessly
follow
the
angels
on
tv
and
gossip
blogs
when
she
meets
jackson
she
does
not
recognize
him
but
jackson
is
instantly
captivated
by
her
and
against
all
odds
the
two
fall
in
love
into
the

this
means
that
the
lunar
rhythm
not
only
reveals
short
intervals
week
month
but
also
serves
as
the
archetype
for
extended
durations
in
fact
the
birth
of
a
humanity
its
growth
decrepitude
wear
and
disappearance
are
assimilated
to
the

in
conclusion
i
highly
recommend
learning
the
principles
of

posture
because
that
is
what
i
have
found
most
helpful
in
addressing
my
prolapse
issues
the
laselle
exerciser
is
a
helpful
way
to
practice
and
ensure
that
i
am
getting
the
posture
right
for
that
reason
i
feel
like
the
laselle
exerciser
would
be
more
effective
if
the
product
included
more
information
regarding
its
use
specifically
counseling
women
on
good
posture
to
prevent
and
correct
prolapse

from
occurring

the
above
examples
remain

us

scared
we

that

just
make

as
we
used
to

something
for
our

too
he
never
treated
the
audience
like
they
were
musically
inept
as
many
so
called
consultants
have
since
they
became
the
vogue
in
programming
in
the
early
1990s
that
my
friend
is
the
beauty
of
the
frankie
crocker
syndrome
the
fact
that
he
was
courageous
enough
to
pick
music
from
the
gut
an
all
inclusive
philosophy
that
i
developed
partly
by
listening
student
style
to
every
show
he
performed
as
much
as
possible
i
cannot
count
the
times
that
i
have
thought
up
a
song
or
said
to
myself
gee
i
haven
t
heard
that

in
a

would
suddenly

tune

was

and
another
reason
why
i
wanted
to
follow
in
his
footsteps
looking
back
it
seems
like
yesterday
but
sadly
my
dream
was
tarnished
along
the
way
because
i
did
not
count
on
having
to
sift
through
all
of
the
insecure
and
messed
up
people
who
were

additionally
there

the

in
case
you
were
worried
i
find
that
each
time
i
read
haiku
or
attend
a
haiku
event
with
readings
i
m
in
the
frame
of
mind
to
go
home
and
write
some
just
by
being
exposed
to
others
haiku
one
receives
a
spark
that
triggers
thoughts
for
poems
in
japan
where
haiku
originated
people
believe
that
the
firefly
s
spark
enlightens
us
it
s
that
sort
of
spark
that
comes
to
us
when
haiku
is
read
or
spoken
example
we
were
all
sitting
around
the
table
eating
dinner
my
daughter
had
asked
to
get
her
ears
pierced
and
i
told
her
we
could
go
on
saturday
we
did
this
and
had
such
a
special
girls
only
day
that
i
will
cherish
forever
she
started
talking
excitedly
about
what
else
we
might
do
at
the
mall
like
maybe
we
could
get
a
pretzel
or
this
is
where
husband
cut
her
off
because
the
nerve
of
this
girl
wanting
a
treat
too
and
said
she
was
being
rude
and
never
thought
of
anyone
else
when
she
talked
and
that
she
wasn
t
going
to
get
a
whole
special
day
just
because
she
wanted
it
so
i
stopped
him
and
said
daddy
meant
we
should
talk
about
our
plans
another
time
but
that
those
are
all
good
ideas
i
stopped
her
tears
before
they
even
formed
i
turned
around
his
hurtful
words
deflected
them
like
bullets
on
wonder
woman
s
bracelets
ba
zing
ba
zing
the
fact
is
that
we
humans
are
not
much
to
be
trusted
with
what
i
am
calling
statistical
knowledge
and
the
larger
the
statistical
quantities
the
less
we
are
to
be
trusted
we
don
t
learn
much
from
big
numbers
we
don
t
understand
them
very
well
and
we
aren
t
much
affected
by
them
the
reality
that
is
responsibly
manageable
by
human
intelligence
is
much
nearer
in
scale
to
a
small
rural
community
or
urban
neighborhood
than
to
the
globe
back
then
the
paper
did
not
cost
as
much
as
it
did
these
days
so
it
was
fairly
easy
to
persuade
people
to
get
it
the
paper
i
sold
was
printed
and
delivered
three
times
a
week
and
only
cost
around
fifteen
dollars
for
a
whole
year's
worth
that
was
a
great
deal
even
then
i
had
no
trouble
selling
in
the
affluent
sections
of
the
suburbs
the
bees
are
here
my
second
year
as
a
bonifide
beekeeper
maybe
last
year
should
not
count
since
my
mentors
did
all
the
heavy
work
for
me
i
was
able
to
add
one
more
hive
this
year
my
original
intention
was
to
add
2
hives
but
sadly
my
bees
did
not
survive
the
winter
it
is
very
hard
to
keep
bees
in
a
hive
alive
through
a
minnesota
winter
esp
like
the
one
we
had
this
past
winter
i
was
not
even
able
to
get
to
my
hives
until
the
end
of
february
and
even
then
the
usual
5
minute
walk
took
me
like
20
minutes
because
every
step
was
a
struggle
i
was
hip
deep
in
snow
and
so
i
had
to
pull
each
leg
out
entirely
to
make
the
next
step
it
was
truly
exhausting
a
great
work
out
though
i
thought
i
was
going
to
have
to
give
up
before
i
even
got
to
the
hives
though
i
was
just
whipped
and
quite
disappointed
to
open
that
first
hive
and
find
a
whole
mess
of
dead
bees
in
there
then
finding
the
same
thing
in
the
second
was
quite
devastating
i
knew
i
was
not
going
to
give
up
but
it
did
put
quite
a
damper
on
any
grand
hive
expansion
i
might
have
had
in
mind
the
first
time
i
stopped
there
enticed
by
the
fruit
boxes
outside
i
was
taken
aback
by
how
quickly
the
young
shop
assistant
popped
out
and
started
ogling
my
every
move
i
was
so
nervous
i
even
dropped
a
tangerine
which
he
hurried
to
rescue
and
assure
me
it
was
ok
he
then
proceeded
to
explain
that
the
oranges
are
good
and
sweet
and
only
2
euros
for
four
would
i
like
some
no
i
would
not
i
felt
a
bit
awkward
though
as
you
feel
sometimes
when
someone
is
trying
to
be
nice
and
you
give
them
the
cold
shoulder
so
when
i
went
inside
to
pay
as
he
placed
my
fruit
on
the
scales
i
noticed
the
peculiar
photo
of
him
posing
in
front
of
the
rows
of
veggie
boxes
outside
the
store
you
will
never
reach
it
reading
one
straw
revolution
by
masanobu
fukuoka
a
book
about
natural
farming
and
no
dig
growing
it
is
a
great
read
so
far
and
makes
so
much
sense
i
have
recently
become
aware
of
the
permaculture
movement
and
this
style
of
gardening
really
appeals
to
me
as
we
are
moving
to
a
farm
soon
and
will
have
4
acres
of
land
to
tend
the
 
do
little
 
route
appeals
to
me
a
friend
of
mine
sold
several
novels
to
numerous
small
presses
all
well
and
good
however
most
of
these
titles
have
not
seen
distribution
through
any
major
outlet
and
therefore
his
ratings
are
slim
these
ratings
do
not
relate
to
the
quality
of
his
work
but
rather
how
well
he
sells
how
much
of
a
brand
his
name
may
be
or
stand
a
chance
of
becoming
it
is
difficult
to
sell
well
if
one
does
not
promote
one's
work
or
if
that
work
is
not
on
display
somewhere
for
the
casual
or
not
so
casual
shopper
kerri
and
misty
in
general
inspire
us
rogers
said
we
ve
talked
about
it
a
lot
and
said
hey
let
s
just
try
and
do
what
misty
and
kerri
do
they
re
just
so
much
better
than
everyone
else
everyone
else
is
catching
up
a
little
bit
but
when
they
turn
it
on
no
one
comes
close
to
them
on
the
men
s
side
it
s
not
that
way
i
recognize
that
we
re
not
going
to
be
108
0
we
re
going
to
lose
a
few
tournaments
so
just
to
be
within
shouting
distance
of
them
i
look
at
that
as
wow
that
s
an
accomplishment
they
push
us
the
one
piece
is
the
perfect
size
for
the
base
of
the
bookshelves
after
it
was
cut
down
that
was
awesome
so
let
me
show
you
today
avon
coral
beat
i
bought
this
polish
last
autumn
but
i
wore
it
a
few
weeks
ago
just
when
my
nail
problems
started
necessity
being
the
motherf
er
of
invention
i
took
my
first
step
at
becoming
an
it
adult
i
was
inspired
by
my
colleague
dean
bunn
here
on
the
uc
davis
campus
who
has
done
incredible
scripting
to
automate
and
make
our
it
day
a
little
shorter
and
easier
thanks
dean
alone
i
putz
a
lot
when
shopping
although
going
with
a
friend
or
daughter
and
stopping
for
coffee
makes
a
nice
day
out
of
it
my
sister
and
i
do
well
together
on
our
trips
when
it
comes
to
window
shopping
not
sure
if
we
trust
our
kids
support
them
and
give
them
safe
places
to
practice
they
will
learn
all
the
skills
they
need
to
learn
as
long
as
they
are
physically
capable
of
doing
so
october
is
my
favorite
month
in
my
favorite
season
i
met
tom
in
october
and
we
got
married
on
that
same
date
4
years
later
we
rescued
benny
and
he
rescued
us
in
october
halloween
is
my
favorite
holiday
the
leaves
are
changing
to
beautiful
colors
of
greens
oranges
reds
and
browns
the
weather
is
cool
and
crisp
and
winter
is
still
a
while
away
sweaters
and
jackets
come
out
of
the
closet
and
it
is
the
perfect
time
for
cooking
warm
comforting
food
like
soups
and
stews

oh
you
can

time
later

poppin
 
those

out
canadians
not

i
do
not

so
maybe
you
and
i
can
chat
about
it
sometime
four
weeks
of
intensive
study
teaching
for
a
few
hours
a
week
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
and
cramming
every
other
spare
second
into
assignments
and
trying
to
understand
the
formation
of
my
own
language
so
she
can
tell
her
stories
to
the
girls
back
home
nothing
will
keep
me
from
her
i
can
only
understand
too
well
why
roland
made
the
choice
he
did
the
fates
because
i
love
her
and
that
s
all
i
know
these
plaques
are
from
joann
and
the
faces
of
them
are
a
little
bigger
than
4x6
it
is
not
quite
as
clean
of
a
look
but
i
still
like
them
i
challenge
any
of
these
liberal
feminists
from
the
media
including
bill
maher
to
spend
24
hours
with
the
five
schlapp
girls
ranging
from
ages
3
months
to
9
years
old
hubby
no
reason
besides
u
used
to
watch
4
little
ones
when
our
kids
were
young
what
happened
the
voices
sound
a
bit
stilted
a
touch
stephen
hawking
but
considering
i
was
able
to
put
this
together
in
a
short
amount
of
time
on
a
budget
of
zero
i
am
really
quite
impressed
with
the
system
this
week
our
specials
and
intervention
time

for

basically
the

there
is
a
relatively
new
christmas
phenomenon
that
s
hit
the

of
which
you
are
probably
unfamiliar
it

called

in
a

an
elf
one
of
those
creepy
ones
from
the
1950
s
with
the
plastic
face
sits
on
a
shelf
in
your
house
and
while
your
children
sleep
he
returns
to
the
north
pole
and
reports
back
whether
the
kids
have
been
good
or
bad
apparently
this
goes
on
for
the
entire

of

we
would
like
to
see
your

lost

the

with
a
twist
the
casino

hires
the

rip
off

if
he
might
get
away
with
it
another
small

his

it
s
interesting
how
the
theme
of

has
evolved
in
such
an
extemporaneous

we
never
planned
this

actually
want

sometimes
it
is
because
i
know
i
am
stressed

in

bad
mood
and
i
want
that
rush
of
adrenaline
that
happens
when
i
feel
myself
in
danger
of
being
spanked
hard
when
you
know
that
someone
loves
you
but
will
still
hurt
you
in
a
specific
focused
way
well
that
brings
the
best
kind
of
adrenaline
rush
and
adrenaline
rushes
tend

all

for

projects
i
decided
to
investigate
three
instances
where
people
were
helping
the
environment
two
of
which
were
making

collegeville

in
the
former
case
the
company
was
working
on
the
environment
and
their
business
model
in
equal
importance
the
second
was
full
of
many
people
of
different
backgrounds
all
of
whom
cared
about
the
environment
to
some
degree
but
found
its
care
incidental
for
the
third
case
where
there
was
little
to
no
profit
i
spoke
with
an
artist
and
a

who
were
in

and
working
within
it
to

something
beautiful
this
semester
long
project
based
around
making
a
difference
in
philadelphia
is
something
i
took
very
seriously
and
then
expanded
it
to
not
just
philadelphia
but
also
immediate
areas
around
philadelphia
this
website
is
dedicated
to
my
final
three
projects
mentioned
above
naomi
shihab
nye
is
one
of
my
favorite
poets
i
heard
her
read
her
poetry
once
and
believe
me
it
was
wonderful
the
first
naomi
shihab
nye
conversation
poem
i
am
sharing
is
kansas
from
her
book
words
under
the
words
of
fairyland
my
works
now
that
is
not
to
say
that
i
do
not
read
and
love
other
genres
too
i
am
quite
a
fan
of
fantasy
and
i
am
falling
more
and
more
in
love
with
contemporary
with
each
novel
i
read
and
last
weekend
i
spent
all
of
30
hours
in
las
vegas
for
a
pigtails
crewcuts
conference
where
i
conducted
workshops
on
blogging
i
flew
in
friday
night
and
got
to
have
dinner
with
a
few
friends
then
i
was
up
early
saturday
for
a
full
day
of
conference
activities
following
by
dinner
with
the
franchisees
it
was
a
fun
crew
and
i
look
forward
to
working
with
them
more
throughout
the
year
they
re
forward
thinking
and
open
to
new
ideas
and
i
ve
become
a
blogging
machine
so
it
s
a
good
match
i
had
about
an
hour
between
my
workshops
and
the
dinner
so
i
walked
up
the
and
checked
out
citycenter
and
the
cosmopolitan
i
can
t
believe
i
ve
been
gone
nearly
three
years
and
yet
aside
from
the
new
buildings
nothing
really
felt
different
i
caught
the
red
eye
at
12
40
a
m
and
landed
in
chicago
at
6
a
m
sunday
it
s
been
an
energizing
couple
of
months
but
now
for
the
foreseeable
future
i
m
pretty
thrilled
to
be
home
hey
guys
its
me
of
course
i
was
reading
the
lost
hero
amazing
book
by
the
way
when
i
thought
to
myself
i
haven
t
made
a
regular
blog
in
a
long
time
or
that
is
in
bold
font
for
that
matter
so
i
finished
the
page
and
here
i
am
typing
away
o
please
read
on
the
whole
gang
present
and
accounted
for
with
a
score
or
so
species
subspecies
and
natural
hybrids
native
to
northeastern
north
america
the
genus
amelanchier
goes
by
several
common
names
many
of
which
represent
the
plants
 
phenology
malaysians
have
come
to
the
political
crossroad
our
country
is
rich
with
natural
resources
yet
we
are
heading
towards
national
economic
melt
down
we
mourn
because
kyle
never
got
to
take
off
his
training
wheels
or
start
his
first
day
of
school
with
a
yellow
backpack
we
mourn
because
braden
never
graduated
high
school
or
went
to
college
or
lost
his
wallet
on
the
marching
band
bus
ride
from
san
antonio
to
indiana
we
mourn
because
julie
miller
will
never
get
her
first
job
or
feel
her
heart
float
like
a
scarlet
balloon
through
the
ceiling
and
over
the
skylines
until
it
hovers
like
a
pinprick
on
the
sun
when
she
looks
at
her
baby
girl
we
mourn
because
howard
will
never
grow
old
with
sylvia
to
cradle
her
finely
wrinkled
hand
in
his
own
reading
nothing
at
all
a
typical
twelve
year
old
child
needs
ten
hours
of
sleep
whereas
an
adult
will
need
about
eight
hours
therefore
most
students
at
school
college
or
university
will
fall
somewhere
between
these
two
figures
however
during
their
teenage
years
they
will
often
experience
a
shift
forward
in
their
sleeping
patterns
meaning
they
can
find
it
harder
to
fall
asleep
until
after
11
p
m
or
even
later
this
means
that
it
can
be
hard
for
a
student
to
achieve
enough
sleep
if
they
have
to
be
up
early
the
next
day
the
person
who
did
the
thinking
man
sculpure
i
m
getting
tired
and
restless
so
i
m
not
going
to
look
up
his
name
hahaha
p
did
a
ton
of
other
paintings
and
they
are
all
downtown
outside
i
was
told
about
this
by
one
of
my
host
mom
s
friends
and
then
she
and
i
went
and
saw
them
the
next
day
he
made
the
hands
and
feet
super
large
so
they
are
out
of
proportion
in
order
to
be
able
to
see
them
and
the
gestures
they
make
from
far
away
at
least
that
is
what
i
was
told

the
scandal
began
after
lomas
was
accused
of
kissing
a
26
year
old
single
mum
in
his
189
per
night
hotel
room
sorry
son
what
ya
say
i
called
them
the
tribe
because
you
always
saw
the
same
faces
at
protests
although
they
held
widely
varying
views
on
the
nature
of
their
mythic
united
ireland
the
campaign
represents
a
school
supply
assistance
program
for
the

for

and

the
starter
packs
include
erasers
last
year
nearly
250
kids
benefitted
from
the
program
and
there
s
every
reason
to
believe
the
need
will
be
even
bigger
this
coming
school
year
penquis
is
looking
for
donors
to
help
empower
our
kids
this
biblical
mandate
is
based
on
the
fact
that
we
belong
to
jesus
christ
we
belong
to
him
for
we
are
bought
with
a
price
and
the
result
according
to
1
corinthians

is
to
glorify
in
your

we
the

i
went
to
the
boy's
school
last
week
to
get
another
training
session
on
using
the
podd
book
with
peter
i
still
have
not
found
a
way
to
incorporate
it
into
life
at
home
they
say
he
is
doing
great
with
it
at
school
he
hates
it
when
we
bring
the
book
out
so
i
said
give
me
something
small
and
manageable
to
start
with
i
can
not
just
start
this
entire
thing
on
my
own
so
we
are
starting
with
it
during
meals
they
ran
through
several
scenarios
with
us
many
alawites
also
joined
the
military
since
ottoman
times
sunni
arabs
had
largely
spurned
army
careers
but
alawites
welcomed
the
opportunity
for
stable
income
by
1963
they
made
up
65
percent
of
noncommissioned
officers
in
the
syrian
army
the
rise
of
alawites
in

society
throughout
the
1960s
was

lucas
dalton
duke
of

is
anything
but
dull
he
s
a
dashing
and
decorated
war
hero
determined
to
help
cecily
even
if
that
means
looking
the
other
way
when
she
claims
the

snow
this

s
most

after
beauty
but
lucas
has
a
reason
for
wanting
cecily
to
join
the
egyptian
club
his
brother
went
missing
during
one
of
lord
hurston
s
expeditions
to
egypt
an
alliance
with
the
explorer
s
bluestocking
daughter
could
bring
lucas
closer
to
the
truth
about
what
happened
or
it
could
lead
him
to
a
more
dangerous
love
than
either
he
or
cecily
could
have
imagined
i
am
not
feeling
up
to
a
sensible
reflection
on
any
of
this
on
account
of
information
overload
but
there
is
a
tone
that
runs
through
much
of
this
discussion
that
does
not
sit
terribly
well
with
me
nostrand
park
who
led
off
the
discussion
on
brooklynian
took
issue
with
the
article's
characterization
of
ch
and
i
agree
with
them
whether
it
is
the
initial
article
passing
off
the
west
indian
day
parade
one
of
the
largest
street
festivals
and
celebrations
of
caribbean
culture
in
the
world
as
a
post
riot
caribbean
festival
that
makes
the
neighborhood
more
desirable
for
condo
building
or
the
language
of
colonization
invasion
deployed
in
so
much
of
this
discourse
i
feel
like
a
i
am
not
learning
a
lot
from
it
and
b
it
is
not
offering
a
very
accurate
or
nuanced
portrayal
of
what
is
actually
happening
in
the
neighborhood
even
the
snarky
mockery
that
lots
of
blogs
comments
employ
strikes
me
as
unproductive
it
is
easy
to
poke
fun
at
the
gentrifyers
but
that
seems
to
be
a
project
for
justifying
one's
own
authenticity
self
awareness
in
the
context
of
neighborhood
change
and
to
raise
a
question
that
was
raised
of
this
blog
in
comments
in
the
post
below
i
wonder
how
many
of
the
people
commenting
on
this
wsj
article
are
ch
residents
and
what
demographic
they
are
in
sticker
shape
standard
stickers
however
every
now
and
then
a
school
that
has
spent
decades
in
the
division
i
wilderness
searching
in
vain
for
the
road
to
the
tourney
finds
its
way
out
of
the
woods
and
into
the
promised
land
two
seasons
ago
it
happened
to
american
university
which
had
just
missed
in
several
patriot
league
tourney
title
games
before
finally
punching
its
ticket
with
a

over
colgate

again
yes
thank
the

some
urban
myths
about
true
colors
the
apostle
peter
was
not
a
jedi
despite
what
may
be
inferred
from
his
writings
i
recently
came
across
a
video
clip
of
carte
blanche
one
of
the
few
sources
of
some
trustworthy
journalism
from
south
africa
please
watch
it
and
take
note
of
certain
parts
the
fact
that
people
are
often
murdered
for
no
reason
at
all
like
we
and
others
have
stressed
so
vehemently
before
that
it
is
nothing
to
do
with
crime
but
rather
hate
crimes
against
whites
and
also
other
races
just
like
farm
murders
have
nothing
to
do
with
theft
or
poverty
these
crimes
are
committed
by
elements
which
know
they
ll
get
away
with
whatever
they
do
that
in
the
worst
case
scenario
where
they
get
caught
and
you
can
research
the
minute
minority
of
cases
actually
solved
there
will
be
an
official
prepared
to
take
a
bribe
to
make
a
case
docket
disappear
but
lovers
are
pipel
hou
the
bbc
s
equally
white
hating
and
racist
ideologues
in
arms
at
the
guardian
manage
to
write
an
article
outlining
congo
s
invitation
to
white
south
african
farmers
who
wished
to
up
sticks
and
farm
there
instead
without
mentioning
why
they
might
wish
to
leave
south
africa
in
the
first
place
the
article
then
finished
with
a
reference
to
the
imminent
invasion
of
congo
how
evil
and
racist
must
these
liberal
journalists
be
that
they
can
wilfully
ignore
an
ongoing
racial
genocide
and
label
those
fleeing
as
invaders
alexander
hamilton
wrote
federalist
paper
63
this
paper
directly
refers
to
the
electoral
college
our
founding
fathers
feared
that
those
who
ran
for
office
could
dupe
the
american
people
into
voting
for
them
these
men
wanted
to
insure
that
the
most
qualified
person
was
elected
president
the
electoral
college
acted
as
check
to
so
that
the
american
people
couldn
t
be
fooled
thanks
for
listening
internets
now
go
back
to
whatever
it
was
you
were
doing
and
whoever
it
was
you
were
doing
it
with
before
you
were
collectively
banned
and
i
decide
i
do
not
care
this
was
after
over
six
inches
of
rain
early
wednesday
morning
and
since
the
photo
was
taken
around
5
00
p
m
the
water
had
actually
receded
quite
a
bit
the
spot
i
usually
stand
in
is
just
to
the
left
of
those
saplings
the
water
was
flowing
pretty
darned
fast
and
we
watched
an
armchair
float
down
the
river
by
tomorrow
morning
the
flow
will
be
slower
and
water
will
be
lower
so
we
will
go
wet
some
line
and
hope
the
fish
are
biting
whatever
you
do
this
weekend
i
hope
it
brings
you
joy

i
hate
when
these
things
happen
on
my
watch
i
hope
this
helps

really
loved

it
says
took

such
as
the

rebels
who
were
no
longer
able
to
fight
the
only
about
having
visitors
aside
from
the
extra
sheets
and
towels
to
wash
is
the
crushing
silence
that
follows
when
they
re
gone
and
yet
in
many
others
i
still
feel
very
much
like
a
failure

sangharsh
morcha
demanded
that
the
ioa
must
immediately
tell
ioc
that
it
will
not
accept
dow
chemical
s
money
it
is
a
matter
of
national
shame
that
the
ioa
and
mr
malhotra
have
succumbed
to
the
temptation
of
american
dollars
and
ignored
the
fact
that
these
dollars
are
coming
from
a
company
responsible
for
death
and
poisoning
of
thousands
of
indian
citizens
he
said
every
time
i
make
the
climb
up
the
stairs
i
can
hear
the
sounds
of
a
community
the
sizzle
of
a
wok
comes
out
from
the
kitchen
window
and
the
smells
of
all
sorts
of
food
entice
me
the
third
floor
window
often
emits
the
noises
of
a
shanghainese
family
playing
mahjong
the
tiles
were
clattering
around
for

houses
yesterday
the
morning
often
features
the
older
residents
out
the
hallways
washing
the
days
vegetables
and
every
morning
as
i
come
out
into
my
kitchen
the
lonely
sound
of
a
violin
wafts
through
the
air
a
very
compelling
argument
there
noam
much
like
the
news
i
somehow
catch
kicks
putting
in
out
of
context
quotes
in
my
writing
the
other
in
a
place
far
more
holy
than
the
first
free
true
tangible
fresh
dusty
exposed
timeless
it
was
still
not
my
but
it
made
much
more
sense
to
me
there
i
am
sure
so
many
of
us
have
heard
about
going
green
in
one
way
or
another
the
world
wants
us
to
do
our
part
in
this
initiative
i
think
its
a
great
concept
the
only
issue
is
helping
people
understand
how
to
do
it
practically
if
you
don
t
show
how
it
saves
money
or
time
people
just
won
t
change
oh
of
course
there
is
always
that
event
that
happens
that
makes
everyone
change
but
i
would
rather
do
it
the
easy
way
being
part
of
a
company
that
was
about
green
initiatives
for
while
taught
me
a
lot
it
taught
me
that
basically
going
green
saves
a
whole
lot
of
money
it
may
cost
more
on
the
initial
start
of
it
at
times
but
over
time
you
save
a
ton
of
money
i
love
reading
submissions
i
do
it
on
the
train
in
and
out
of
work
and
often
at
weekends
because
submissions
are
a
treat
you
never
know
what
little
gem
you
are
going
to
uncover
and
what
scary
thing
is
lurking
in
the
depths
so
while
i
am
away
my
submissions
will
remain
untouched
because
i
read
all
my
own
hopefully
a
wonderful
little
story
will
come
in
while
i
am
relaxing
and
i
will
get
to
have
all
the
fun
of
finding
it
when
i
get
back
do
not
let
your
life
pass
you
by
nick
s
issue
with
the
show
also
popped
up
with
the
mars
episode
in
the
episode
the
kids
fly
all
the
way
to
mars
and
land
at
the
base
of
olympus
mons
and
then
spend
the
majority
of
the
episode
climbing
the
mountain
by
foot
while
rocket
changes
shape
and
drives
up
next
to
them
this
is
where
nick
lost
it
and
so
right
now
i
m
working
daily
to
reshape
my
feelings
about
this
whole
situation
i
can
t
in
good
conscience
send
my
child
off
to
school
in
the
morning
in
a
cloud
of
anguish
and
anxiety
nothing
could
be
more
unfair
to
her
this
response
is
multiply
confused
first
each
universe
in
the
ensemble
is
not
simple
but
is
characterized
by
a
multiplicity
of
independent
constants
and
quantities
if
each
universe
were
simple
then
why
did
dawkins
feel
the
need
to
recur
to
the
hypothesis
of
a
world
ensemble
in
the
first
place
besides
the
issue
is
not
the
simplicity
of
the
fundamental
laws
for
all
the
universes
in
the
ensemble
are
characterized
by
the
same
laws
where
they
differ
is
in
the
values
of
the
constants
and
quantities
if
i
will
ever
get
to
pay
he
said
why
did
you
pick

hello
all
i
have
yet
another
change
to
my
blog
an
even
healthier
change
aside
from
posting
about
gluten
free
recipes
i
will
be
adding
in
diabetic
friendly
recipes
now
i
have
been
diagnosed
with
type
2
diabetes
gee
i
wonder
why
i
have
posted
lots
of
yummy
recipes
here
i
am
ok
knowing
i
have
it
i
have
accepted
it
i
am
exercising
at
least
30
minutes
every
day
and
eating
healthier
and
still
gluten
free
i
am
very
happy
to
say
that
i
have
lost
15
lbs
since
oct
when
i
went
gluten
free
i
have
started
charting
my
daily
workouts
on
dailymile
com
so
feel
free
to
workout
follow
along
with
me
and
we
can
keep
each
other
motivated
you
can
see
my
little
mile
tracker
in
my
side
bar
there
where
to
start
when
in
doubt
i
usually
turn
to
my
bff
j
k
rowling
for
wisdom
people
really
seemed
to
like
her
rags
to
riches
story
the
whole
struggling
single
mum
on
welfare
makes
good
angle
so
with
that
in
mind
i
m
going
to
tell
you
something
something
that
not
a
lot
of
people
know
about
me
24
thankful
for
my
children's
friends
i
love
watching
them
play
with
their
friends
and
i
am
so
glad
they
have
good
friends
from

everyone
angie

great
news

if
i
have
to
explain
number
what
to
do
for
him
at
the
number
four
mark
then
you
need
to
stop
reading
this
altogether
and
take
a
long
look
in
the
mirror
and
be
ashamed
my
first
memory
that
i
can
remember
is
of
my
mom
she
is
pregnant
with
my
little
sister
and
she
is
showing
me
her
belly
explaining
to
me
how
to
be
a
big
sister
i
remember
my
favorite
outfit
to
play
dressup
in
was
the
dress
that
my
mom
wore
on
her
first
date
with
my
dad
in
my
world
it
was
a
place
of
magic
with
princesses
and
princes
and
dragons
and
knights
and
there
was
never
a
time
that
she
told
me
it
was
not
she
encouraged
us
to
dream
to
live
life
in
color
and
i
have
done
that
and
never
looked
back
she
sped
to
bring
me
clothes
the
time
some
girls
in
middle
school
poured
water
down
my
pants
just
so
that
i
could
face
them
in
the
same
day
even
in
the
midst
of
what
at
the
time
seemed
like
her
biggest
failure
my
mom
was
the
one
with
a
deathlock
grip
on
me
just
telling
me
over
and
over
that
she
was
going
to
fight
for
me
when
i
called
her
from
800
miles
away
asking
if
32
days
was
too
soon
to
plan
a
wedding
she
was
my
biggest
advocate
but
children
grow
up
as
i
have
learned
to
my
sorrow

a

i

that

just
as
curious
passionate
and
interested

as
me
even

then
filled

this
was
by

the

i
have
made
so
far
usually
my

a

incorporates

when

you
went

for
about
an
hour
thank
you
for
holding
my
hand
while
you
slept
in
my
bed
i
did
not
get
to
fall
back
asleep
but
holding
your
little

was
worth
it
you
may
not
be
the
best

but
i
would
not

you
for
one

racists
are
a
strange

i
am

there
are
very
well
to
do
racists
but
these
tend
not

be
the
ones
who
are
out

proud
racists
the
racist
we
see
on

are
ignorant
incoherent
knuckle
dragging
thugs
fixated
on
telling
everyone
that
they
are
not
actually
racist
and
reminding
everyone
who
will
listen
that
they
will
not
tolerate
any

dubbel
miere
is
a
strong
golden
ale
that
has
had
an
addition
of
lake
hawea
manuka
and
clover
honey
added
the
result
is
a
full
bodied
golden
ale
with
a
hint
of
spicy
honey
on
the
nose
a
hint
of
fruity
hop
and
floral
honey
in

and
a
crisp
refreshing
finish
kauri
is
described
as
an
old
flemish
dark
with
an
infusion
of

the
result
is
a
steely
dry
dark
ale
with
a
hint
of
tannic
woodiness
and
a
long
roasty
finish
finally
miner
galore
is
described
as
being
a

with

the
resulting
beer
was
fruity
and
mellow
with
some
lovely
rich
malt
bright
hops
and
a
hint
floral
rosebud
all
three
beers
are
interesting
and
although
a
little
surprising
for
those
of
us
who
expected
the
belgian
brewer
to
produce
some
big
belgian
style
beers
the
next
three
seasonals
are
due
soon
and
will
revolve

for

sort

i
also
cut
some

and
put
them
through
my
cuttlebug
because
i
am
not

wether
i
like
that
look

not

i
may
just
put

the
1960s
were
turbulent
times
and
for
those
whose
youth
was
spent
in
that
decade
after
the
falls
coming
of
age
in
the
sixties
a
memoir
by
catherine
gildiner
will
ring
many
familiar
bells
it
begins
with
her
starting
high
school
and
the
youthful
adventures
common
to
that
era
she
is
a
natural
storyteller
who
grew
up
to
become
a
clinical
psychologist
in
private
practice
her
earlier
memoir
too
close
to
the
falls
drew
wide
acclaim
sadya
k
i
oty
anvaham
edhat
sat
this
book
was
good
but
i
could
tell
harris
was
wrapping
up
the
series
a
lot
of
closure
in
this
book
and
a
lot
of
story
telling
and
not
much
action
so
i
was
a
little
disappointed
in
that
there
were
also
a
few
characters
that
we
have
grown
to
love
that
just
do
not
even
make
an
appearance
in
this
book
but
there
are
some
that
we
love
that
make
an
appearance
like
bubba
love
him
i
am
really
ready
for
the
fairy
drama
to
wrap
up
but
i
suppose
that
will
be
the
big
bang
in
the
last
book
crane
was
shot
dead
in
her
car
in
november
2003
while
traveling
to
the
johannesburg
high
court
to
attend

trial
of
alleged
israeli
mafia
member
lior
saat
accused
of
murdering
crane's
estranged
husband
near
sunninghill
gauteng
in
1999
aa
source
close
to
crane
said
that
she
knew
too
much
being
able
to
identify
and
implicate
a
number
of
figures
in
the
saat
case
she
was
the
third
state
witness
in
the
saadt

be
murdered

still

says

wept
because
the
pharasees
would
not
let
him
bring

take

that
reflect

other

we
have
not

prime
question
in

fields
of
morals
and

is
what
i
see
when
i
look
in

not
when
i
watch

then
i
did
what
i
always
do
i
googled
it
i
put

knock

and
came
across
a

describing
this

from

i
honestly
can
not
see
a

can
you
i
have

several
items
from
them
in

including
a
queen

for
our

no

and
1

i
have
yet
to
be
disappointed
i
read
the
reviews
for
the
light
very
helpful
and
ordered
it
right
away
a
week
later
i
had
this
boy
i
sure
woke
up
in
a
chipper
mood
this
morning
for
absolutely
no
reason
at

or
maybe
it

because
i
was

crisp
ideal
for
a
crispy
side
on
a
curry
night
just
right
for
a
slather
of
hot
chutney
as
evidenced
by
my
ancient
post
over
on
the
fat
expat
it
is
a
struggle
in
the
twenty
first
century
but
even
though
we
downsized
our
home
we
increased
our
property
have
clean
air
and
clean
water
and
a
minimum
of
electronic
noise
surrounding
us
it
s
not
for
everyone
but
it
can
be
done
if
you
take
the
time
to
study
your
choices
and
get
in
touch
with
what
you
want
out
of
life
we
will
never
say
die
ever
we
had
our
2nd
saturday
altered

club
meeting
at
jean's
lovely
victorian
home
that
was
built
in
the
1800
 
s
here
is
jean
about
to
open
her
gift
the
gifts
were
hand
made
for
the
person
whose
name
we
drew
though
mr
karzai
appeared
elated
at
the
ceremony
he
has
frequently
expressed
frustration
with
the
american
presence
bitterly
criticizing
the
united
states
on
issues
like
night
raids
conducted
by
special
operations
troops
and
civilian
casualties
was
interested
in
where
the
less
than

so
here
is
how
it
broke
down
i
have
817
connections
yes
a
member
of
the
500
club
however
there
is
a
rule
for
my
connections
as
i
must
know
them
and
they
must
know
me
in
short
requests
come
in
every
day
from
folks
because
they
work
for
the
same
company
or
we
are
members
of
a
group
in
common
these
won
t
be
accepted
as
they
don
t
meet
the
criteria
above
of
knowing
each
other
which
matches
with

could

how
many

people
with

have
come
to
me
about

for

well
all
i
can
say
is
it
is
a
lot
more
common
than
you
think
here
are
some
ideas
i
can
not
exactly
explain
how
to
do
any
of
them
as
i
have
not
tried
them
all
but
by
lots
of
patience
and
playing
around
it
will
be
a

to
flaunt
any

my

came
up
with
vocabulary
flashcards
with

like

he
also
created
about
six
flashcards
with
facts
on

top
it

and
getting
to
meet
the

who
bring
some
of
my

to

was
fantastic
i
handed
out

me
feel
better
when
i
am
missing
this
incredible

all
though
admittedly
i
sometimes
wish
i
really
could
hang
out
with
those
characters
for
real
especially
davis
aunt
mimi
jeanette
and
antoine
those
are
my
favorite
characters
i
also
got
to
meet
john

and
that
was
a
highlight
too
what
a
charming
man
i
hung
around
for
awhile
after
not
wanting
to
miss
out
anything
i
giggled
when
i
passed
wendell
pierce
on
my
way
down
the

and
said
to
him
it
was
nice
to

the

two

calls
from
two
of
the
gals
rob
had
affairs
with
and
who
were
members
of
the
yacht
club
i
d
been
up
very
early
that
day
got
myself
and
my
son
ready
so
we
could
arrive
early
to
make
sure
things
were
in
order
i
was
very
calm
and
unemotional
which
was
great
i
answered
the
phone
and
my
stepdad
was
sitting
on
the
couch
in
my
family
room
straight
across
from
me
i
can
t
remember
now
who
called
first
but
i
think
it
was
karyn
who
i
affectionately
nicknamed

have

we
have
chosen
a
different
imaging
place
this
time
because
we
feel
that
the
one
we
went
to
for
avery's
ultrasounds
was
lacking
in
knowledge
i
feel
like
they
should
have
noticed
that
something
was
not
right
with
her
between
her
lack
of
proper
growth
and
the
way
her
umbilical
cord
looked
they
should
have
noticed
something
anything
i
was
trying
to
live
my
life
on
this
new
theory
that
you
only
live
once
but
who
wants
to
live
a
life
full
of
bad
decisions
simply
because
we
are
trying
to
be
carefree
i
know
i
will
find
a
happy
medium
i
am
just
wondering
when
the
rod
of
iron
so
why
short
stories
you'd
wonder
where
you
are
see
it
iced

trimmed

time
with
an
expected
7pm
flight
to

of
course
the
kolkata
flight
is
late
by
2
hours
and
i
should
have
known
that
was
the
norm
not
the
exception
red
summer
blue
autumn
white
winter
green
spring
it
was
a
regular
day
in
the
mid
west
i
would
describe
the
weather
to
you
but
i
don
t
remember
i
do
remember
being
miserable
as
usual
i
hated
being
in
illinois
every
day
i
woke
up
in
my
bed
trying
to
figure
out
which
tree
or
intersection
i
could
drive
my
car
into
the
only
thing
that
stopped
me
was
knowing
that
your
grandmother
and
grandfather
are
co
signers
to
some
of
my
student
loans
debt
runs
my
world
and
i
couldn
t
leave
this
planet
knowing
that
i
am
leaving
my
parents
with
an
extra
bill
to
pay
with
this
in
mind
i
woke
up
every
morning
and
continued
on
with
my
day
attended
class
hung
out
with
some
friends
fought
with
my
roommates
and
tried
to
muster
enough
strength
to
repeat
the
process
the
next
morning
an
analogy
would
go
something
like
this
suppose
a
loving
father
warns
his
child
not
to
stray
from
the
house
into
the
road
he
warns
the
child
that
if
the
he
goes
into
the
road
he
could
get
hit
by
a
car
and
die
this
is
a
true
and
sound
warning
however
also
suppose
that
the
father
is
perfect
and
was
watching
the
child
at
all
times
every
time
the
child
wondered
too
close
to
the
road
the
father
would
run
out
and
grab
the
child
and
bring
him
back
into
the
yard
the
sound
of
music
festival
has
grown
to
be
a
formidable
force
i
fulfilled
a
life
long
fantasy
by
catching
devo
s
set
there
last
summer
but
it
used
to
be
a
much
smaller
affair
a
review
of
medical
literature
done
in
early
2003
found
that
five
plant
extracts
and
69
compounds
isolated
from
plants
have
been
shown
to
have
antitumor
activity
against
ovarian
cancers
cuevita

a

and

selection
featuring
in
high
school
the
art
teacher
i
did
not
like
moved
up
to
teach
at
our
school
so
i
never
took
art
i
took
stained
glass
instead
because
that
teacher
would
let
me
explore
the
medium
i
would
make
blown
glass
dragons
and
flowers
and
things
like
that
texas
governor
rick
perry
the
front
runner
stumbled
badly
in
last
week's
debate
and
if
he
has
another
couple
of
bad
outings
he
could
very
well
fade
away
not
only
were
a
number
of
his
answers
weak
but
he
failed
to
take
the
battle
to
the
other
candidates
leaving
people
wondering
how
he'd
actually
do
against
president
obama
it
is
a
day
to
celebrate
love
everyday
leading
up
to
this
day
this
year
i
have
tried
to
shower
my
little
munchins
with
as
much
love
as
possible
to
remember
to
take
a
moment
a
deep
breathe
when
i
am
about
to
scream
i
have
also
been
working
hard
on
making
cards
to
celebrate
we
are
off
to
visit
adam's
parents
this
weekend
and
we
are
going
to
pick
up
a
bookshelf
from
my
mom's
house
so
i
may
have
some
more
basement
progress
to
share
too
what
are
you
up
to
this
weekend
have
a
great
one
i
colored
all
my
images
with
my
copic
markers
and
just
had
so
much
fun
making
these
cards
so
listen
to
them
i
wish
with
all
my
heart
that
i
had
listened
to
julie
that
day
piercing
eyes
so
what
have
the
securities
and
banking
industries
received
for
their
political
contributions
on
the
other
side
of
things
a
cousin
posted
this
on
facebook
is
not
the
whole
point
of
living
for
making
sacrifices
daily
and
not
for
40
days
out
of
the
year
and
only
cares
about
our
spiritual
choices
and
things
that
will
affect
our
spirit
not
about
things
like
whether
we
eat
meat
or
not
i
just
do
not
understand
why
the
church
would
have
you
sacrifice
something
natural
like
candy
that
does
not
cause
spiritual
gain
in
my
opinion
unless
like
you
said
you
give
up
something
that
takes
up
your
time
it
seems
to
me
that
sacrificing
by
mowing
a
neighbors
lawn
or
helping
out
your
mom
will
only
make
you
a
better
person
a
good
person
i
guess
you
could
say
but
good
people
will
not
be
in
heaven
only
godly
people
will
be
in
heaven
the
old
testament
focused
on
natural
sacrifices
but
that
all
changed
in
the
new
testament
you
re
reading
the
blog
of
the
newest
member
of
the
anonyme
scrappere
team
i
m
so
proud
that
lovely
anja
blogowner
and
teamleader
asked
me
if
i
want
to
join
them
after
i
had
been
a
guest
in
july
if
i
want
to
he
he
he
i
didn
t
even
consider
turning
this
awesome
offer
down
count
me
in
some
conservative
voices
in
the
medical
community
feel
that
the
normalization
of
change
surgeries
was
the
start
of
a
slippery
you
keep
pushing
the
envelope
of
impaired
people
who
aren
t
in
touch
with
reality
in
some
fashion
who
develop
ideas
about
their
normalcy
says
dr
mark
schiller
a
psychiatrist
and
past
president
of
the
association
of
american
physicians
and
surgeons
essentially
from
just
claiming
that
something
s
the
case
people
just
accept
somebody
s
distorted
version
of
reality
and
then
we
get
surgeons
and
others
responding
to
the
point
of
mangling
normal
bodies
cydia
i
have
trouble
reading
off
a
screen
good
for
mary
i
say
she
got
herself
noticed
albeit
not
entirely
in
a
positive
way
there
over
a
period
of
time
in
foreign
languages
mainly
asian
and
arabic
were
inane
remarks
with
links
to
other
sites
a
few
days
after
that
first
appointment
i
left
the
country
to
go
on
vacation
careful
not
to
do
anything
that
may
further
aggravate
my
neck
as
much
as
i
tried
i
couldn
t
help
but
go
surfing
boogie
boarding
kayaking
and
swimming
careless
yes
but
being
out
of
a
stressful
work
environment
in
a
warm
climate
worked
wonders
even
though
i
was
already
feeling
much
better
shortly
after
returning
from
vacation
i
visited
an
acupuncturist
rmt
who
came
highly
recommended
from
my
chiropractor
when
i
visited
my
chiropractor
again
a
few
days
after
having
acupuncture
he
was
amazed
at
how
my
condition
had
improved
and
proceeded
to
do
another
session
of
art
and
prescribe
a
new
set
of
exercises
to
help
speed
along
my
recovery
what
was
your
initial
reaction
and
how
did
you
celebrate
when
you
were
first
accepted
for
publication
or
when
you
first
saw
your
debut
story
in
book
form
on
a
bookseller
s
shelf
how
sweet
and
lovely
are
these
moments
of
revealing
clarity
it
is
why
focusing
a
camera
is
so
much
fun

me

times
a

when

they
hanged
him
on

the

had
to
find

that
on
at

4
occasions
the
cabinet
approved
travel

to
the

of
hundreds
of
thousands
of

for
your

there
is
a
huge
struggle
in
france
between
the
prosecution
and
the
instruction
judge
breham
says
that
unlike
a
prosecutor
this
independent
judge
has
investigative
powers
to
subpoena
officials
from
dcn
and
access
documents
in
the
dcn
offices
to
obtain
evidence
of
commissions
the
judge
can
also
request
mutual
criminal
assistance
from
the
malaysian
authorities
for
purposes
of
information
and
cooperation
so
far
there
is
no
indication
that
malaysian
officials
intend
to
cooperate

poor

sorry
there
are
some
pretty
appalling
websites
that
attract
large
female
audiences
as
well
one
that
a
friend
pointed
out
to
me
recently
is
jezebel
which
covers
gossip
culture
fashion
and
for
the
contemporary
woman
five
as
they
marveled
the
party
passed
between
the
enormous
statues
which
formed
a
narrow
pathway
between
them
beyond
the
statues
was
a
huge
iron
gate
that
went
from
the
floor
to
the
ceiling
with
great
thick
bars
the
width
of
a
man
s
wrist
the
gate
was
swung
wide
open
and
so
they
walked
through
as
always
the
night
is
not
about
looking
for
subtle
flavour
nuances
in
the
beer
that
lap
gently
at
the
edges
of
the
high
notes
in
each
dish
or
striving
to
find
the
apparent
apricot
note
in
the
hops
and
the
digestive
biscuit
sweetness
in
the
malt
it
s
all
just
about
finding
for
yourself
that
beer
and
food
actually
work
quite
well
together
without
looking
for
indicated
cues

there

islamic
extremism
on
campuses
not
only
continues
unabated
it
continues
as
this
report
demonstrates
to
flourish
we
hope
that
now
the
government
and
university
authorities
will
finally
act
before
a
generation
of
students
continues
to
be
prey
to
an
intolerant
separatist
and
violent
ideology
which
threatens
our
society
and
the
lives
of
not
just
of
our
citizens
but
as
was
shown
again
on
christmas
day
those
of
our
allies
and
friends
sleep
habits
since
anna
s
toe
disaster
i
haven
t
really
wanted
her
to
sleep
in
her
bed
call
it
mama
guilt
or
insanity
but
anna
has
been
sleeping
in
our
bed
the
past
week
which
means
we
get
no
sleep
old
habits
die
hard
because
my
child
is
still
sleeping
like
this
aparently
sloane
believes
that
nothing
good
ever
comes
about
voluntarily
that
innovation
only
occurs
at
the
barrel
of
a
gun
sadly
he
s
not
alone
in
this
worldview
a
good
many
people
also
subscribe
to
the
notion
that
without
a
government
directing
every
aspect
of
our
lives
we
d
all
be
lost
as
tom
woods
notes
in
rollback
it
is
not
the
case
that
without
the
political
class
our
limbs
would
be
blown
off
by
exploding
consumer
products
and
we
d
all
be
working
in
a
mine
for
a
dollar
a
day
then
i
took
a
blender
marker
and
dipped
it
into
a
big
bottle
of
colorless
blender
solution
and
dripped
it
onto
the
colored
areas
simple
fun
washed
out
coloring
in
deep
abasement
bending
if
history
is
any
indicator
then
i
think
you
know
the
answer
as
hayes
puts
it
the
fact
is
winding
and
dusting
and
fixing
somebody
else
s
old
clock
is
boring
building
a
brand
new
clock
of
your
own
is
much
more
fun
especially
if
you
can
pretend
that
it
s
going
to
inspire
awe
and
wonder
for
the
ages
to
come
so
why
not
have
the
fun
now
and
let
the
future
generations
do
the
boring
bit
i
think
hayes
is
right
it
seems
humans
are
by
nature
builders
and
not
maintainers
if
all
sorts
of
bells
whistles
and
screaming
authority
figures
are
going
off
in
your
head
right
now
you
are
not
alone
like
i
said
schooling
is
a
very
deeply
conditioned
and
strongly
reinforced
default
in
our
society
we
like
to
have
control
of
outcomes
and
we
fear
what
would
happen
outside
of
the
controlled
but
by
no
means
universally
successful
system
of
education
that
defined
our
own
youth
we
like
to
have
control
of
children's
lives
after
all
we
are
responsible
for
them
and
we
worry
what
they
will
get
into
if
they
are
not
constantly
scheduled
and
corralled
into
planned
experiences
what
do
kids
get
up
to
when
they
are
not
dictated
a
daily
agenda
what
is
to
keep
my
kids
from
just
playing
games
all
day
long
well
certainly
not
me
will
help
us
put
these
principles
into
practice
what
is
intimacy
first
let
s
take
a
closer
my
pick
though
is
a
nice
version
of
love's
theme
with
flute
brass
and
voices
being
used
instead
of
strings
completely
incomplete
there
could
be
no
grosser
misconception
of
the
realities
than
is
entertained
by
those
who
vociferously
demand
legislation
as
they
call
it
against
discrimination
the
discrimination
and
the
deprivation
the
sense
of
alarm
and
of
resentment
lies
not
with
the
immigrant
population
but
with
those
among
whom
they
have
come
and
are
still
coming
it
had
been
over
a
month
since
he
had
been
to
our
house
for
a
sleepover
we
were
so
excited
as
we
anticipated
the
next
two
days
with
this
little
boy
who
would
be
celebrating
his
third
birthday
in
just
a
couple
months
as
the
three
of
us
sat
down
to
eat
dinner
that
first
evening
with
chicken
nugget
in
hand
he
looked
at
me
and
his
papaw
and
simply
said
i
missed
you
guys
melt
is
the
word
that
described
our
hearts
at
that
moment
it
s
not
like
cole
hadn
t
seen
us
for
weeks
and
weeks
in
fact
we
stayed
over
at
his
house
for
new
year
s
eve
and
we
traveled
together
to
indiana
for
christmas
but
in
his
little
boy
heart
he
had
missed
us
we
knew
the
feeling
we
had
missed
him

charlie
s
mother
wrote
that
she
broke
down
the
day
she
discovered
the
words
i
am
disgusting
written
on
the
inside
of
his
arm
she
was
shocked
to
learn
the
cause
of
her
son
s
personality
change
was
addiction
not
drugs
or
drinking
the
nurse
explained
that
it
would
actually
be
impossible
for
me
to
go
to
the
bathroom
since
the
baby
was
blocking
everything
she
said
the
sensation
was
caused
by
the
baby
moving
down
into
my
pelvis
in
other
review
news
i
thought
this
article
in
the
new
york
times
blog
about
the
7
most
overused
words
in
book
reviews
was
pretty
funny
i
think
i
am
guiltly
of
using
or
overusing
at
least
four
this
outfit
i
thought
was
more
girly
than
the
others
therefore
i
directed
my
model
to
be
in
more
inclosed
areas
of
the
forest
as
the
colours
of
the
outfit
would
make
her
stand
out
what
i
thought
was
effective
about
these
photographs
was
how
you
can
even
see
the
rain
in
some
of
them
when
zoomed
in
i
really
like
the
one
where
she
s
looking
around
it
creates
a
sense
of
adventure
i
think
of
course
this
is
very
cheap
you
can
t
buy
a
loaf
of
bread
for
that
price
no
one
is
arguing
with
that
but
do
such
authors
really
deserve
flack

here's
a
little
taste
from
last
night
i
always
did
well
in
school
i
felt
like
it
was
my
only
positive
characteristic
people
tell
me
i
m
smart
but
i
think
my
decent
memory
fools
people
that
and
i
m
very
analytical
too
a
fault
what
do
you
do
with
that
then
they
asked
yet
the
album
was
slagged
by
many
critics
labels
such
as
confused
flawed
awkward
dated
and
misogynistic
abounded
and
those
were
the
good
reviews
i
always
found
that
last
criticism
a
bit
odd
given
there
were
two
girls
in
the
band
whatever
but
then
the
same
criticism
gets
leveled
at
the
white
stripes
as
a
child
in
the
1960s
i
loved
to
vist
my
local
libarary
in
arnold
it
was
a
much
older
building
than
the
one
in
the
picture
above
and
i
remember
it
had
the
inscription
carnegie
library
carved
above
the
door
the
town
had
obviously
been
a
beneficary
of
the
charity
set
up
by
enlightened
philanthropist
andrew
carnegie
in
those
days
we
were
issued
with
library
tickets
 
and
when
you
took
the
books
of
your
choice
to
the
desk
the
librarian
would
take
the
card
from
the
inside
the
book
and
insert
it
into
one
of
your
five
tickets
and
into
an
indexed
box
the
book
would
duly
be
stamped
to
be
returned
in
two
weeks
time
i
seem
to
recall
that
i
would
be
back
long
before
the
two
weeks
was
up
eager
to
make
my
next
choice
simply
put
in
every
way
possible
example
i
was
reviewing
an
alphabet
book
with
my
son
beckett
this
afternoon
on
the
couch
see
below
for
the
story
as
read
by
someone
on
youtube
the
very
first
letter
a
for
aardvark
admiring
brought
on
the
first
question
mommy
what
s
an
aardvark
i
had
no
idea
how
to
explain
an
aardvark
my
solution
i
pulled
out
my
iphone
typed
in
aardvark
to
google
and
clicked
on
the
wikipedia
entry
there
was
enough
information
in
that
entry
an
entry
created
by
who
knows
how
many
users
from
across
the
globe
that
i
could
comfortably
explain
enough
about
an
aardvark
to
satiate
my
three
year
old
s
curiosity
except
that
he
wanted
to
see
more
pictures
back
to
google
this
time
to
search
google
images
for
aardvarks
back
to
the
book

is

than

and

until

i
believe
that
anything
is
possible
there
have
always
been
those
who
manage
to
obtain
this
ultimate
state
of
grace
whilst
in
physical
flesh
but
they
have
been
here
as
your
living
proof
and
guiding
lights
you
call
them
ascended
masters
and
in
the
usual
state
of
physical
being
one
does
not
feel
they
can
live
this
way
all
of
the
time
it
s
not
about
whether
you
can
be
in
this
state
when
you
clean
the
toilet
of
course
you
can
that
s
easy
what
the
difficulty
has
been
is
staying
in
a
state
of
grace
when
interacting
with
people
and
their
reactions
in
your
daily
life
it
s
easy
to
wander
about
in
a
state
of
grace

your
own

also

strikes
this

as
wholly
proper
and
reasonable
that
what
in
the
case
of
england
and
then
britain
has
taken
centuries
to
build
should
continue
to
inspire
the
devotion
and
loyalty
of
its
citizens
that
we
do
have
obligations
to
protect
what
has
been
bequeathed
to
us
by
time
and
place
that
it
is
right
and
proper
that
we
honour
our
dead

used

conspires
to

lucifer
was

he
was
called

the

tells

he
was
beautiful

powerful

had

lucifer
had

us
all
out

for

lovely

out
there
we
walked
up
to
that
first
bridge
you
see
towards
the
bottom
but
did
not
do
the
hike
up
to
the
top
as
my
post
surgery
foot
is
still
not
up
to
tons
of
walking
yet

i
also
got
some
awesomely
cool
harry
potter
themed
candy
it
is
a
chocolote
frog
i
was
seriously
freaking
out
about
that
i
do
not
think
i
could
go
two
minutes
without
saying
something
like
it
is
a
chocolate
frog
is
not
that
the
coolest
thing
ever
dad
i
do
not
think
my
dad
really
knew
what
to
say
about
this
though
he
has
not
read
the
harry
potter
books
but
he
has
seen
the
movies
so
at
least
it
might
have
made
some
sense
to
him
but
my
mom
has
not
seen
the
movies
or
read
the
books
so
she
was
probably
wondering
what
was
so
exciting
about
it
but
what
is
not
exciting
about
that
it
is
comes
with
a
collectable
wizard
card
and
everything
i
got
professor
mcgonagall
in
the
end
i
m
not
entirely
sure
what
i
was
supposed
to
take
from
the
ballad
of
jack
and
rose
it
s
such
a
specific
story
and
the
narrow
focus
makes
it
difficult
for
some
of
the
larger
themes
to
translate
for
example
the
rebellion
of
adolescence
is
a
pretty
universal
concept
but
as
it
develops
within
rose
s
insular
world
her
form
of
rebellion
can
be
hard
to
relate
to
even
for
someone
who
knows
some
of
where
she
s
coming
from
thank
you
so
much
for
joining
us
we
can
not
wait
to
see
what
you
make
therefore
i
am
also
planning
to
work
out
at
the
gym
i
ought
to
be
tackling
considering
how
big
game
board
i
don
t
care
if
you
say
is
anwar
i
say
maybe
but
you
cannot
become
prime
minister
that
is
the
reality
said
raja
petra
picture
in
an
interview
published
today
the
malay
language
mingguan
malaysia
some
would
rather
blame
it
on
ghosts
because
they
are
too
afraid
to
speak
about
the
death
according
to
tanya
quinn
the
things
that
the
children
will
remember
the
most
about
their
party
is
the
fun
things
they
did
and
the
fun
characters
they
met
when
it
comes
to
baking
with
bananas
my
motto
is
the
riper
the
better
extra
ripe
bananas
mash
easier
and
they
are
extra
sweet
which
adds
to
the
overall
flavor
of
the
cake
the
price
is
not
yet
determined
nor
does
rim
share
any
details
on
which
u
s
carrier
will
introduce
the
bold
though
at
t
seems
to
be
the
most
likely
however
there
is
no
single
carrier
commitment
like
the
iphone
the
blackberry
bold
is
supposed
to
hit
the
market
in
summer
2008
possibly
around
the
same
time
frame
as
iphone
2
around
june
so
if
you
have
been
waiting
for
buying
a
cool
sleek
new
device
it
might
be
a
good
idea
to
compare
the
two
and
see
which
one
fits
your
needs
while
iphone
continues
to
be
a
choice
for
video
and
multimedia
features
with
its
large
display
and
attractive
touchscreen
the
blackberry
bold
could
be
a
competitive
option
for
business
and
enterprise
needs
on
a
global
scale
trends
suggest
that
consumers
are
increasingly
looking
to
understand
where
their
food
comes
from
and
exactly
what
goes
into
it
hearst
ranch

two

now
we
have
been
in

for
3
months
now
and
we
are
all
fitting

quite
nicely
even
matthew
who
i

had
the
hardest

adjusting
i
love
my

and
i
love
their

well
matthew's

anyway
josie's

i
am
kinda
 
meh
 
about

she
is

and

does
not
have

the
beef
tartare

barely
recognisable
at

hidden
beneath
a
glossy
red
blanket
of
beetroot
jelly
we
find
a
pillow
of
tartare
beneath
the
jelly
pre
mixed
but
seasoned
well
i
find
the
beetroot
tends
to
overwhelm
this
dish
with
its
earthiness
but
the
grains
of
puffed
wild
rice
give
a
pleasant
textural
contrast

when
i
am
swimming
most
days
and
do
not
want
to
use
my
shu

for

i
alternate
with
the
klorane
products
they
are
not
a
substitute
or
as
effective
but
they
are
less
expensive
and
mild
enough
for
every

shampooing

then

the

it

i

i
admittedly
enjoy
reading
up
about

but
food
culture
sort

misses
me
i
think
a
part
of
me
wants
to
understand
because
i
really
do
love
a
variety
of
foods
but
i
always
seem
to
fall
short
once
it
starts
to
sound
like
an
novel
about
rare
ingredients
then
again
i
suppose
the
alternative
isn
t
much
better

to

my
only

in

why
she
s
here
i
walk
closer
and
get
a
view
of
what
she
s
wearing
my
eyes
widen
with
shock
a
skin
tight
red
leather
dress
leaves
little
to
my
vast
imagination
thin
straps
hold
up
perked
up
cleavage
and
it
ends
right
about
where
the
curve
of
her
backside
would
poke
out
if
she
were
standing
a
me
dress
if
i
ve
ever
seen
one
the
matching
4
inch
red
leather
heels
don
t
do
much
to
negate
this
impression
i
walk
past
her
and
head
to
the
bathroom
a
little
out
of
sorts
some
days
you
just
don
t
know
what
to
expect
and
there
s
no
cover
that
will
ever
explain
the
book

why
does
that

me
as

yes
this
was
a
very
eat
pray
love
moment
for
me
but
what
is
life
if
not
a
collection
of
little
rituals
we
complete
to
make
ourselves
feel
better
aside
from
maybe
brushing
your
teeth
what
does
the
rest
really
do
and
i
had
gotten
so
stuck
in
a
little
funk
about
this
i
needed
something
big
to
shake
it
from
my
system
in
case
you
can
not
tell
i
am
very
into
metaphorical
change
i
still
feel
sad
for
my
losses
and
hurt
i
have
created
but
at
least
i
now
know
it
is
out
there
in
the
world
and
not
just
buried
in
my
heart
part
of
the
earth
s
intention
in
the
gulf
was
to
get
the
conscious
attention
of
humanity
focused
on
the
earth
the
rupture
was
resolved
but
have
you
noticed
its
most
lasting
impact
it
has
solidified
a
level
of
consciousness
an
awareness
of
abuse
of
power
of
greed
and
of
human
stupidity
it
has
focused
our
attention
at
a
level
of
consciousness
that
is
absolutely
necessary
to
maintain
in
order
to
go
through
this
shift
with
a
greater
level
of
stability

then
the

suffice
it
to
say
that
the
process
for
a
pod
book
is
similar
though
the
formatting
is
different
of
course
and
you
get
a
proof
of
your
lovely
book
to
hold
and
smell
and
wave
at
people
and
remind
you
how
clever
you
are
writing
all
this
and
then
you
have
to
read
it
looking
for
mistakes
yes
you
really
do
i
know
you
have
read
it
so
often
your
eyes
bleed
at
the
first
sentence
but
this
is
the
last
chance
to
find
typos

every

should
understand

behind
the
various
practices
by
making
genuine
self
enquiry
once
the
use
of
the
practice
has
helped
reach
a
certain
level
the
person
must
let
go
and
pick
up
the
next
level
of
practices
as
one
progresses
from
the
physical
plane

my
first
thought
after
leaving
school
at
18
was
to
get
myself
to
vienna
to
pay
homage
at
the
grave
of
beethoven
his
music
had
irradiated
me
thrilled
me
sent
shivers
down
my
adolescent
spine
excited
me
to
a
world
view
of
limitless
olympian
joy
he
had
to
be
thanked
so
i
and
a
particularly
complaisant
friend
set
off
hitch
hiking
to
vienna

version
of
this
saga

my

whose

was

is

in

i
do
not
know
why
and
as
for
 
ad
le
 
her
real

was
gudrun
well
after
working
on
my
original
layout
as
seen
in
the
last
postfor
2
of
the
scrapbooking
nights
i
decided
it
would
just
do
my
own
thing
on
the
last
one
i
had
one
more
photo
from
my
childhood
that
i
wanted
to
get
done
so
went
to
work
on
it
as
my
baby
brother
david
was
wearing
an
outfit
with
a
 
sailor
 
theme
to
it

i
would
use

much

angry

for
the

i
wait

but
i
figure
i
get
a
fresh
start
again
so
everything
is
now
forgiven
the
slate
is
wiped
clean
and
we
can
all
have

ozzy
is
my
cousin
s
son
i
am
friends
with
him
unlike
nelly
who
hates
him
ozzy
is
seldom
at
our
territory
when
nelly
is
around
that
is
taking
a
huge
risk
i
am
friends
with
many
cats
anyway
ozzy
s
very
nice
and
friendly
and
i
often
have
a
little
chat
with
him
it
would
mean
a
lot
if
you
have
an
account
and
like
this
well
i
really
think
my
entry
should
win
because
this
set
has
it
all
whenever
you
like
to
be
green
here
is
a
style
guide
the
man
that
wrote
ss
seemed
very
sweet
in
his
response
so
ss
thought
it
would
be
nice
to
send
him
a
little
note
thanking
him
for
responding
and
being
so
kind
our
very
kind
sponsors
are
whoever
hasn
t
heard
of
this
or
never
got
round
to
read
it
you
should
go
read
it
asap
i
advise
you
to
read
the
manga
because
the
anime
ends
at
a
mere
62
episodes
if
you
have
lived
in
the
area
this
task
is
both
difficult
and
easy
easy
because
you
do
not
have
to
do
any
outside
research
difficult
because
something
familiar
can
be
overlooked
and
taken
for
granted

joe
stange's
got
a
major
piece
on
session
beer
coming
out
in
draft
magazine
this
summer
can
not
wait
to
see
it
especially
in
light
of
this
new
post
on
his
blog
thirsty
pilgrim
he
throws
cold
water
on
the
whole
idea
that
session
beer
is
trending
upward
in
the
u
s
citing
ratebeer
com
data
on
new
beer
introductions
over
the
past
ten
years
that
is
my
excuse
for
not
blogging
lately
well
the
new
found
hatred
of
the
blogger
interface
and
the
bajillion
reports
i
have
to
write
by
thursday
reports
are
not
my
favourite
time
of
year
then
when
he
retired
he
still
photocopied
the
puzzle
every
day
for
his
beautiful
bride
he
took
the
copy
mom
took
the
original
naturally

would
have
it
no
other

apple

well
this
year
it
was
obviously
the
avengers
the
preview
itself
i
can
t
say
was
the
actual
one
min
thirty
sec
that
it
became
on
the
youtube
but
i
waited
and
found
it
right
before
me
on
the
computer
and
i
the
better
for
it
for
i
was
thoroughly
unimpressed
i
mean
bam
boom
it
looks
like
it
s
going
to
be
one
of
a
cgi
popcorn
funny
flick
with
kick
action
but
still
for
me
i
could
get
that
with
mip
or
any
jason
statham
movie
that
way
too
it
wouldn
t
be
taking
a
visual
on
the
characters
that
i
hold
ever
so
dear
i
believe
that
i
could
go
and
see
these
films
and
not
have
them
be
the
comics
and
still
enjoy
them
but
i
for
one
do
not
appreciate
the
character
interpretation
or
even
the
story
i
mean
where
have
all
the
kick
avengers
chicks
gone
also
might
i
just
add
that
i
was
watching
the
trailer
and
i
had
my
little
brother
come
up
and
say
they
aren
t
very
intimidating
are
they
i
mean
you
get
captain
thor
iron
man
hulk
hawkeye
and
black
widow
on
a
team
and
you
should
be
wetting
your
pants
he
s
right
you
should
be
yet
this
team
has
yet
to
prove
its
mettle
everyone
here
knows
my
dislike
of
the
captain
america
portrayal
i
mean
cap
s
supposed
to
be
a
force
to
be
reckoned
with
he
is
supposed
to
be
a
presence
not
a
down
and
out
aw
shucks
block
from
a
simpler
time
mr
stark
oy
vey
sure
not
everyone
agrees
with
my
interpretation
of
cap
but
come
see
come
saw
a
momentum
is
occurring
but
they
cast
aside
many
a
demon
in
those
two
minutes
1
it
was
the
day
i
got
my
first
paraffin
wax
treatment
to
make
my
old
lady
hands
feel
softer
ooh
it
makes
me
wonder
rusi
if
you
had
to
listen
to
one
song
for
the
rest
of
your
life
what
would
it
be
btw
i
really
love
you
guys
and
the
blog
you
guys
are
my
homepage
i
know
it
s
about
45
minutes
long
but
i
urge
you
to
watch
it
it
contains
some
really
cool
footage
and
some
great
eye
opening
research
poems
and
songs
with
pipes
and
drums
if
you
look
carefully
you
can
see
our
black
rooster
we
now
have
two
roosters
one
older
and
more
sedate
and
another
who
only
recently
started
crowing
there
is
quite
a
lot
of
rivalry
between
the
males
so
we
are
thinking
of
giving
one
away
initially
when
we
only
just
started
out
with
our
chicken
adventure
we
only
wanted
to
keep
females
but
it
turns
out
roosters
fight
away
stray
cats
the
way
hens
do
not
do
at
first
it
was
annoying
remember
the
what
if
we
said
just
wait
petition
started
by
a
priest
out
in
seattle
i
think
that
had
more
anonymous
signatures
than
actual
names
in
any
case
that
project
has
lost
much
of
its
momentum

as
numbering
what
i
ve
learned
in
my
personal
life
is
that
acting
upon
or
encouraging
the
homosexual
feelings
puts
a
wedge
between
and
i
when
i
allow
that
sin
to
take
over
it
literally
takes
over
then
i
m
generally
back
to
square
one
with
opening
myself
up
to
jesus
and
running
back
to
him
sadly
true
priestliness
is
not
in
abundance
in
the
church
because
too
many
priests
are
called
by
man
and
not
by
the
evidence
being
this
whoever
you
spend
the
most
time
with
is
who
you
will
become
like
ministers
of
today
spend
more
time
communing
with
and
serving
their
mentors
than
and
that

when
confronted
with

evidence
some
men
just
want
to
get
the
strap
up
the
pants
and
bounce
for
some
it
s
a
conquest
and
i
can
say
from
experience
as
soon
as
the
is
over
we
will
lose
interest
women
you
know
how
you
hate
when
a
man
makes
himself
too
available
it
s
the
same
paradigm
the
only
value
we
have
for
you
is
external
this
just
doesn
t
stem
from
guy
to
guy
we
re
built
to
think
this
way
example
i
had
with
a
woman
30
45mins
after
meeting
her
in
the
bar
afterwards
i
couldn
t
even
look
her
in
the
eye
i
didn
t
want
to
talk
or
even
touch
her
again
it
was
just
all
too
easy
to
obtain
so
mentally
i
completely
disconnected
from
her
all
together
ever
wonder
why
he
doesn
t
call
or
text
back
he
has
no
value
for
you

went

one
of

it
looked

but
that
s
what
we
were
for
a
long
time
2
tsp

oil
prefer
getting
or

giving
can
you
remember
back
to
when
you
had
babies
to
care
for
and
how
careful
you
were
with
their
bedding
you'd
make
sure
the
sheets
were
clean
and
straight
you'd
make
the
little
bed
several
times
a
day
and
as
soon
as
there
was
a
wet
sheet
into
the
washing
machine
it
would
go
you
did
those
things
and
more
because
you
knew
how
important
that
bed
was
to
your
baby
well
i
might
be
reverting
to
babyhood
because
i
tend
my
bed
as
carefully
as
i
would
a
cot
or
crib
and
i
do
it
because
sleep
is
important
now
let
me
declare
my
bias
here
up
front
i
love
my
bed
always
have
always
will
i
am
a
good
sleeper
i
am
rarely
in
bed
more
than
ten
minutes
before
i
am
sound
asleep
but
i
also
do
a
lot
of
my
thinking
in
bed
in
the
cool
dark
hours
of
the
morning
and
being
in
an
uncomfortable
bed
would
not
be
conducive
to
my
sleeping
or
thinking
if
i
want
to
get
the
most
out
of
every
day
i
need
to
sleep
well
i
approached
the
check
in
counter
rather
apprehensively
with
all
my
bags
and
handed
over
ticket
and
passport
along
with
a
big
smile
i
waved
my
bulging
carry
on
bag
at
the
ground
staff
and
asked
if
it
was
ok
for
carry
on
quite
what
i
would
have
done
if
she
has
said
no
i
am
not
quite
sure
though
part
of
my
keenness
in
being
early
is
to
be
able
to
regroup
in
the
event
of
something
like
that
happening
she
gave
it
a
cursory
nod
and
asked
if
it
had
any
liquids
in
it
being
completely
dry
it
was
apparently
fine
for
carry
on
along
with
the
carrier
bag
of
books
and
my
handbag
and
the
fleece
and
pashmina
that
i
was
carrying
you
get
the
picture
it
was
not
much
fun
going
through
security
taking
out
my
laptop
and
placing
all
of
these
into
the
trays
the
staff
were
quite
bemused
to
see
me
fill
four
trays
still
i
was
though
and
able
to
head
to
the
airline
lounge
only
an
organisation
obsessed
with
the
creed
of
diversity
and
lacking
in
moral
integrity
would
have
allowed

like
dizaei
to
rise
up
its
hierarchy

gain

funimation's

z
season
four
is
one
of
my
favorite
season
sets
once
you
get
past
the
garlic
jr
saga
you
are
in
for
a
terrific
thrill
ride
you
get
some
awesome
fights
that
do
not
drag
on
and
the
season
ends
with
an
intriguing
mystery
this
set
can
be
bought
for
chump
change
either
online
or
in
stores
if
you
do
not
mind
the
wide
screen
format
this
is
an
exceptional
way
to
view
some
awesome
dbz
sagas
what
is
your
problem
advancing
your
career
with
online
programs
and
certificates
and
then
he
sees
them
weeks
ago
that
i
was
going
to
start
posting
recipes
sharing
their
points
and
no
matter
how
good
we
thought
the
idea
was
how
breakthrough
how
strategically
sound
how
oh
so
right
for
their
brand
the
fact
is
i
can
count
on
one
hand
the
number
of
times
a
client
dug
deeper
to
fund
a
great
idea
out
of
around
2000

over
14
years
and
one
of
them
was
three
months
ago
she
is
number
one
rated
but
she
is
already
jaded
i
promise
to
get
hammered
and
never
complain
about
a
hangover
just
a
quick
post
today
i
have
not
abandoned
the
blog
just
had
to
take
time
out
for
gallbladder

this
past
week
i
am
feeling
better

they

are

i
saw
today
with
weeds
growing
all
around
it
and
vines
climbing
onto
it
he
then
advised
that
mr
van
zyl
must
remove
all
his
belongings
from
the
car
he
then
ordered
him
to
sit
in
his
car
whilst
he
spoke
to
a
fellow
colleague
standing
close
by
he
then
joined
him
in
the
car
and
began
a
concerted
effort
to
scare
and
intimidate
him
by
advising
that
him
that
in
jai
lhe
would
most
probably
be
assaulted
and
he
then
asked
him
what
he
mr
van
zyl
can
do
for
him
to
make
all
of
this
go
away
shabab
fighters
still
control
large
parts
of
central
and
southern

but
are
facing

from
regional
forces
with
kenya
in
the
far
south
ethiopia
in
the
south
and
west
and
african
union
troops
in
mogadishu
my
hope
is
we
can
get
questions
answered
without
my
having
to
engage
in
a
one
on
one
email
conversation
do
not
forget
to
add
seam
allowances
to
the
cut
edges
when
you
cut
out
your
fabric
when
you
are
ready
to
sew
just
reassemble
the
cut
pieces
to
make
whole
pattern
pieces
and
assemble
your
garment
as
usual
i
know
many
of
you
probably
think
i
have
vanished
from

but
i
have
been
here
just
overwhelmed
with
no
crafty
and
life
this
time
of
year
i
think
is
just
cursed
for
me
i
swear
it
seems
for
the
last
5
yrs
from
feb
to
may
nothing
goes
right
for
me
whats
that
saying
when
something
goes
wrong
it
all
goes
wrong
i
do
apologize
and
everyday
i
think
i
need
to
get
online
and
post
something
and
my
day
just
flies
by
just
like
the
other
day
i
started
this
blog
post
and
started
getting
wordy
and
lengthy
and
just
sputtering
and
whining
and
thought
this
is
not
what
i
want
to
post
and
took
a
break
well
i
never
got
back
to
the
post
til
today
between
phone
calls
emails
appts
physical
therapy
napping
alot
and
sleeping
which
during
the
night
not
so
much
hence
lots
of
naps
there
just
is
not
enough
productive
hours
in
the
day
the
joshua
tree
though
continues
to
resonate
i
don
t
listen
to
it
a
lot
but
it
do
come
back
to
it
fairly
regularly
really
a
sure
sign
of
a
work
of
lasting
value
as
an
ex
bullied
person
the
worst
thing
you
can
do
is
shut
yourself
away
staying
at
home
and
avoiding
people
allows
your
fears
to
go
unchallenged
and
for
your
confidence
to
stay
low
how
do
you
know
whether
people
out
there
are
good
and
friendly
if
you
don
t
go
out
and
give
them
a
chance
even
going
for
a
walk
on
your
own
can
lighten
your
mood
and
help
you
feel
more
in
touch
with
the
outside
world
get
in
touch
with
friends
go
out
for
a
meal
or
to
the
cinema
interacting
with
people
will
build
your
confidence
and
take
your
mind
off
your
worries
it
will
also
give
you
a
more
healthy
and
balanced
outlook
on
the
world
it
s
not
as
scary
as
you
might
think
and
there
s
a
lot
of
good
things
to
get
involved
in
in
the
meantime
i
read
a
cnn
column
today
that
made
me
laugh
if
you
want
to
read
it
in
its
entirety
go
here
written
by
comedian
dean
obeidaliah
the
short
version
was
this
snippet
mix
all
ingredients
together
in
one
bowl
put
in
greased
muffin
tin
bake
at
325
degrees
for
approx
45
minutes
or
until
toothpick
comes
out
clean
after
a
game
yes
i
am
a
horrible
person
a
horrible
person
who
actually
considered
dangling
a
benjamin
in
front
of
that
boy
and
daring
him
to
fetch
it
with
his
teeth
but
nooooooo
he
had
to
go
off
and
pull
a
heist
and
be
a
big
frickin
 
antihero
about
it
whatever
buddy
404
i
mean
he
was
my
book
buddy
in
1st
grade
the
kid
taught
me
how
to
read
the
least
i
could
do
was
give
him
head
candy
cookie
in
the
jars
it
made
me
feel
like
i
was
in
a
street
of
italy
oh
i
want
to
visit
italy
for
free
eat
for
free
too
call
me
greedy
tourists
helped
themselves
with
an
espresso
the
co
owner
connie
said
they
ve
opened
for
close
to
10
months
i
did
not
ask
no
further
if
they
re
financially
okay
i
m
hope
they
re
i
only
came
to
enjoy
my
time
go
visit
them
if
you
re
reading
this
first
off
the
cover
states
requiem
for
a
coward
but
the
story
is
the
vendetta
they
fix
that
in
issue
66
by
putting
the
wrong
title
on
that
cover
as
well
school
starts
in
3
weeks
hurray
1
responding
in
song
was
a
natural
thing
to
do
because
jupiter
is
a
person
and
cancer
is
the
place
which
gives
jupiter
the
best
resources
to
fulfill
his
primary
mission
why
cancer
first
you
have
to
get
to
know
the
person
named
jupiter
the
farther
i
headed
down
geary
the
closer
i
got
to
russia
ever
since
i
can
remember
as
an
adult
random
russians
and
probably
ukranians
too
have
come
up
to
me
to
ask
me
something
maybe
the
time
directions
but
in
russian
not
english
it
used
to
make
me
laugh
and
was
always
a
little
surprising
how
did
they
know
i
grew
up
in
san
jose
sometimes
i
would
ask
after
explaining
i
did
not
understand
the
question
and
if
they
spoke
english
they
said
they
could
tell
i
was
one
of
them
from
my
nose
my
lips
my
features
gave
me
away
sigh
that
is
all
i
can
do
is
sigh
a
perfect
example
of
time
consuming
and
low
calorie
pomegranate
seeds
are
perfect
for
sunday
movie
night
they
are
just
sweet
and
enough
to
keep
you
coming
back
for
more
but
considering
the
work
you
have
to
do
to
get
to
each
individual
seed
even
a
whole
pomegranate
a
whopping
105
calories
will
probably
last
you
through
an
entire
two
hour
movie
plus
they
are
a
great
source
of
potassium
and
vitamin
c
meaning
they
are
perfect
for
a
day
relaxing
sore
muscles
silently
down
hi
all
so
my
attitude
is
not
as
cruddy
as
before
so
no
need
to
be
scared
off
i
was
just
quite
irritated
with
the
whole
day
for
right
now
there
is
only
farm
match
i
can
wait
to
see
what
other
new
learning
apps
will
be
added
to
the
site
first
off
a
card
i
like
to
serve
these
on
100
whole
wheat
sandwich
thins
thin
buns
depending
on
what
is
on
sale
and
available
i
grab
arnold
or
earth
grains
my
husband
and
kids
usually
like
theirs
plain
but
i
like
to
top
mine
with
some
organic
baby
spinach
red
onion
banana
peppers
and
tomato
i
usually
serve
these
with
a
fresh
fruit
mixture
and
roasted
sweet
potato
fries
or
a
veggie
and
pasta
salad
stay
tuned
for
those
recipes
creme
wandering
from
vendor
to
vendor
entranced
by
the
smells
and
colors
finally
managed
to
get
her
mom
to
buy
her
a
few
things
a
small
doll
who
was
also
wearing
a
blue
vest
some
roasted
chestnuts
because
lunch
was
still
a
little
ways
off
and
they
still
needed
to
tour
the
city
together
before
heading
over
the
the
keep
with
the
rest
of
the
crowds
for
the
unvieling
after
lunch
so
this
thanksgiving
in
our
home
i
will
be
attempting
the
three
p's
that
make
it
special
for
me
to
me
and
hope
that
those
who
come
to
share
this
day
of
thanks
with
us
feel
loved
and
special
the
way
i
truly
hope
they
will
let
s
break
down
the
scripture
a
bit
jesus
invites
us
to
come
meaning
we
have
to
act
on
our
part
jesus
always
invites
but
so
often
we
can
be
so
stubborn
and
not
go
to
him
jesus
is
not
gonna
drag
us
going
to
him
needs
to
be
our
choice

today
however
is
the
final
straw
waking
up
at
5am
on
my
day
off
with
severe
in
pain
in
my
back
and
right
side
from
a
kidney
stone
was
beyond
necessary
this
is
it
you
have
to
go
it
is
just
not
working
out
and
quite
frankly
i
am
wondering
if
you
are
out
to
me
january
2001
after
rob
s
death
it
was
clearly
written
by
somebody
who
doesn
t
have
children
the
contents
of
my
handbag
are
strewn
around
dorset
on
a
regular
basis
usually
in
the
search
for
wetwipes
teething
rings
my
mobile
phone
etc
gingrich
does
it
contemplate
that
some
day
we
could
have
a
rocket
my
point
in
the
speech
i
made
yesterday
which
is
on
cspan
and
i
d
love
to
have
all
of
you
look
at
it
it
s
based
on
having
looked
at
space
issues
since
the
late
1950
s
when
missiles
and
rockets
was
a
separate
magazine
and
working
with
nasa
and
others
i
believe
by
the
use
of
prizes
by
the
use
of
incentives
by
opening
up
the
space
port
so
that
it
s
available
on
a
ready
basis
for
commercial
fight
by
using
commonsense
for
example
the
atlas
v
could
easily
be
fixed
into
a
man
capable
vehicle
so
you
didn
t
have
to
rely
on
on
a
russian
launch
or
a
chinese
launch
hania
kept
asking
me
whether
i
had
figured
out
the
being
s
identity
no
i
hadn
t
she
seemed
highly
amused
by
my
cluelessness
finally
unable
to
contain
herself
any
longer
she
told
me
who
he
was
i
was
completely
surprised
despite
knowing
all
about
her
channeling
relationship
i
had
been
confused
by
his
ordinariness
i
explained
having
previously
encountered
him
as
a
much
more
impressive
presence
she
said
that
he
sometimes
appears
in
this
very
human
guise
and
other
times
shows
his
larger
self
well
that
s
true
of
those
of
us
who
are
embodied
too
and
so
it
seems
quite
plausible
to
me
here
are
her
words
jesus
christ
out
of
his
love
for
me
makes
himself
as
large
or
small
as
is
needed
to
allow
me
to
be
with
him
best
at
the
time
our
relationship
has
an
aspect
of
being
friends
and
he
will
make
himself
to
whatever
scale
is
most
reassuring
for
me
at
the
time
so
i
can
maintain
this
feeling
so
as
not
to
intimidate
me
and
throw
me
off
the
friends
track
sometimes
he
is
immeasurable
other
times
as
you
experienced
him
then
the
greystones
scores
well
on
having
a
good
beer
range
and
i
admit
that
this
was
a
bit
of
a
quandary
i
did
not
want
to
get
but
i
did
want
to
fit
in
another
pub
at
least
in
the
end
i
decided
to
get
the
bus
down
to
the
end
of
eccy
road
and
pop
in
the
ex
pomona
now
renamed
the
ecclesall
at
least
that
is
what
i
wanted
to
do
however
a
35
minute
wait
for
a
missing
bus
meant
it
was
gone
half
three
before
i
set
off
so
i
changed
my
plans
i
decided
to
get
off
in
town
and
walk
to
the
sheffield
tap
since
i
had
to
go
to
the
shops
for
some
supplies
for
the
night
ahead
i
thought
that
if
nothing
else
i
could
get
some
draught
beer
to
take
out
from
there
i
ll
have
a
longer
post
i
m
sure
later
on
how
the
whole
hotel
experience
went
hint
not
as
well
as
the
car
experience
but
in
summary
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
drive
to
cincinnati
and
look
forward
to
more
road
trip
with
the
family
in
the
future
as
well
as
we
sleep
in
the
car
instead
of
a
hotel

i
m
trying
very
hard
not
to
pay
attention
to
what
the
woman
in
the
skimpy
outfit
on
my
right
has
going
on
trying
very
very
hard
linda
has
been
instrumental
in
berner
trail
public
school
winning
the
gold
standard
as
an
eco
school
has
lead
the
school
choir
for
a
generation
and
even
sang
the
anthems
at
a
blue
jays
game
as
a
teacher
and
an
artist
and
an
environmentalist
linda
has
left
her
mark
on
her
profession
and
her
school
the
first
thing
to
mention
is
that
all
the
people
who
work
there
are
incredibly
friendly
everyone
we
met
from
the
car
parking
staff
security
the
tour
guides
the
hospitality
staff
and
even
the
shuttle
bus
drivers
were
all
incredibly
nice
loved
to
talk
about
harry
potter
in
great
depth
and
were
happy
to
take
pictures
of
us
with
the
exhibits
it
really
does
make
a
difference
to
the
atmosphere
when
the
staff
engage
with
the
subject
as
deeply
as
the
audience
and
have
knowledgeable
tidbits
to
share
with
anyone
who
cares
to
justin's
brother
got
a
girlfriend
that
he
knew
a
long
time
ago
before
i
was
around
meaning
justin's
mom
has
known
her
longer
than
she
is
known
me
hi
everyone
happy
easter
and
happy
passover
not
so
much
fun
where
were
the
cool
costumes
what
is
this
boring
play
you
want
me
to
learn
how
many
lines
now
this
question
was
not
to
belittle
me
or
attack
me
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
thought
this
would
have
been
asked
a
lot
more
and
more
frequently
transunion
equifax
take
note
your
bar
attorneys
will
not
be
able
to
us
for
a
sleep
over
afterwards
the
problem
was
that
most
people
wanted
some
proof
of
this
accomplishment
perhaps
a
copy
of
the
anthology
in
which
their
poems
appeared
or
a
plaque
and
that
s
where
the
fees
applied
the
anthology
cost
over
50
bio
25
poems
on
a
cd
a
plaque
a

it
all
adds
up
unlikely
here
are
ten
comments
questions
that
no
woman
or
girl
ever
wants
to
hear
at
the
moment

may
save
you
from

scorn

in

chance
to
not
get
knocked
back
to
start
my
opinion
i
was
going
through
my
news
feed
one
afternoon
and
saw
that
we
had
let
our
coach
go
which
i
questioned
at
first
but
seeing
how
terrible
we
did
this
year
i
knew
we
had
to
change
something
we
also
let
go
of
greg
oden
which
was
a
change
i
have
waiting
for
for
a
couple
years
now
oden
had
been
benched
for
three
years
with
re
occuring
injuries
and
surgeries
and
never
played
they
reduced
his
salary
but
to
me
that
wasn
t
enough
even
my
dad
a
huge
blazers
fan
as
well
didn
t
know
why
we
kept
him
and
agreed
with
me
that
we
should
have
let
him
go
last
year
i
saw
the
amount
trades
we
were
doing
and
was
hoping
to
high
heaven
that
we
would
at
least
keep
luke
babbit
nicolas
batum
and
lamarcus
aldridge
gin
vanilla
beans
grapefruit
zest
ripe
guavas
chinese
five
spice
powder
and
a
stalk
of
lemongrass
are
infused
over
night
and
then
built
into
a
tasty
beer
punch
the
next
day
with
fresh
lime
juice
citrusy
ipa
and
sugar
this
is
our
recreation
of
punch
originated
by
washington
dc
bartender
jon
harris
you
have
never
had
anything
like
it
we
promise
you
the
only
problem
is
that
even
your
two
pin
cellphone
charger
will
not
go
in
there
i
shopped
around

found

happens
to
be
saint
valentine's
day
and
i
hope
some
nice
fellow
s
shower
you
with
flowers
and
chocolate
you
are
a
fine
young
woman
and
you
deserve
the
very
best
i
like
the
new
church
but
the
get
to
know
you
part
is
painful
vulnerable
and
a
mine
field
of
potentially
awkward
questions
which
in
a
small
town
you
are
expected
to
answer
my
mother
told
me
this
week
that
she
believes
i
am
a
bruised
person
that
whether
people
mean
well
or
not
any
contact
hurts
right
now
i
guess
i
would
have
to
agree
the
people
are
nice
there
but
i
find
myself
tearing
up
in
their
midst
at
the
pain
of
being
apart
from
my
kids
mildred
packer
was
a
young
woman
from
rural
kansas
who
came
to
red
river
in
the
summer
of
1971
her
and
her
husband
came
for
a
few
weeks
each
summer
and
always
stayed
in
the
same
hotel
her
husband
became
popular
with
the
drinking
crowd
in
town
while
mildred
tended
to
spend
all
day
in
and
around
the
hotel
according
to
local
legend
she
was
a
shy
timid
woman
with
an

physically

how
far
you
go
in
life
depends
on
your
being
tender
with
the

compassionate
with
the

sympathetic
with
the
striving
and
tolerant
of
the

on
my
mind
feat
lentle
kay
by
carnyiso
as
i
look
down
again
at
the
watch
the
time
reads
1
43am
the
brief
exposure
of
my
wrist
to
the
cold
causes
the
hairs
on
my
arm
to
stand
on
end
immediately
the
sensation
runs
up
my
arm
and
down
into
my
chest
and
back
like
my
fingertips
were
plugged
into
the
mains
1
44a
m
and
i
m
beginning
to
wonder
does
she
see
me
i
try
and
hold
back
a
wry
smile
as
the
thought
occurs
to
me
that
she
does
see
me
in
fact
she
is
watching
me
too
locked
together
in
a
game
which
neither
of
us
is
truly
certain
we
have
an
opponent
the
idea
warms
me
for
a
split
second
until
the
chill
of
the
night
regains
its
upper
hand
i
reach
inside
the
pocket
of
my
jacket
and
take
out
the
cigarette
packet
pulling
the
last
slender
stick
and
placing
it
to
my
lips
i
don
t
even
worry
the
burning
end
will
give
away
my
location
a
single
orange
ember
like
the
last
manned
lighthouse
in
sea
of
dark
and
concrete
i
m
calling
to
her
now
do
not
fear
do
not
perish
come
toward
my
light
and
shelter
in
my
embrace
here
at
rancho
firstnations
we
are
hard
as
nails
and
metal
as
therefore
we
decorate
with
dead
animal
parts
now
the
pepper
plants
are
at
the
correct
size
for
what
they
should
be
right
now
i
should
be
able
to
get
them
into
the
ground
right
around
the
correct
time
the
photo
above
shows
the
plants
from
the
old
seeds
and
the
heirlooms
the
flat
of
new
seeds
are
having
a
really
hard
time
sprouting
in
fact
i
put
the
cover
back
on
them
tonight
i
don
t
think
they
have
gotten
warm
enough
to
open
the
seeds
yet
mr
est
vez
seemed
a
bit
depressed
and
it
seemed
that
he
did
not
go
outside
much
anymore
and
that
he
had
not
had
contact
with
anyone
in
a
long
time
i
am
not
sure
if
i
was
in
the
dream
or
not
at
this
point
and
i
think
that
there
were
some
flashbacks
of
times
when
him
and
his
group
used
to
meet
at
the
apartment
like
house
but
i
am
not
sure
i
do
know
that
when
they
are
older
and
telling
their
own
children
about
their
grandmother
they
will
be
able
to
say
that
she
stood
in
the
storm
and
when
the
wind
did
not
blow
her
way
and
it
surely
has
not
she
adjusted
her
sails
and
the
one
thing
i
cannot
wrap
my
mind
around
my
intention
was
to
present
in
book
form
the
spirit
of
nonduality
com
hence
there
is
a
variety
of
writings
from
different
traditions
and
fields
of
endeavor
it
s
a
good
introduction
to
nondual
writings
and
perspectives
i
am
not
very
good
at
doing
things
like
sitting
still
relaxing
and
staying
off
my
feet
which
are
rather
important
before
a
big
race
so
e
was
amazing
at
getting
me
to
stay
put
i
could
not
ask
for
a
better
support
crew
coach
running
advisor
is
this
really
your
final
5
but
don
t
you
remember
i
hope
you
all
had
a
wonderful
holiday
weekend
the
fam
and
i
were
away
last
week
enjoying
all
of
the
sunshine
on
the
central
california
coast
and
i
have
lots
to
share
we
stayed
in
morro

toured
california

daughter
did
a
bit
of
kayaking
in

hello
vampirates
fans
welcome
to
the
sixth
stop
at
justin
somper's
vampirates
immortal
war
blog
tour
i
am
sure
a
lot
of
you
have
been
enjoying
the
treats
from
this
exciting
blog
tour
so
far
and
there
is
more
fun
to
come
today
we
get
a
glimpse
at
justin's
tastes
in
music
as
he
reveals
the
music
behind
vampirates
to
be
just
me
i
am
still
working
on
it
i
fell
off
the
path
a
lil
while
ago
but
that
handy
gps
got
me
back
to
where
i
needed
to
be
i
can
honestly
say
i
am
happy
today
as
was
i
yesterday
and
the
day
before
my
mom
noticed
the
subtle
change
of
dullness
to
smile
i
thought
it
was
just
the
weather
lately
for
me
losing
the
light
a
lil
bit
cj
is
helping
me
bring
it
back
and
the
funny
part
is
he
does
not
even
realize
i
think
how
happy
he
does
make
me
he
brings
out
just
me
i
really
liked
the
format
that
this
bible
study
used
each
week
has
it
s
own
memory
verse
plus
each
week
s
lesson
is
divided
into
six
daily
mini
lessons
each
daily
mini
lesson
centers
on
its
own
verse
s
and
its
own
topic
plus
every
day
there
are
two
questions
for
personal
reflection
the
seventh
day
is
the
group
discussion
questions
it
is
not
a
static
opposition
to
be
sure
but
a
historical
one
it
is
eerily
familiar
in
truth
the
first
scene
is
that
of
enclosure
the
privatizing
by
force
of
common
lands
that
inaugurates
the
modern
world
of
employers
and
employees
commodities
and
wages
blood
and
fire
the
second
scene
is
that
of
globalization
wherein
every
corner
of
the
earth
must
be
drawn
into
the
dream
of
liberal
democracy
open
to
all
in
so
far
as
every
corner
of
the
earth
might
thereby
become
another
outpost
of
the
market
hiring
a
few
dispossessing
a
few
more
and
assuring
that
commerce
is
equally
available
to
each
with
sufficient
coin
in
purse
the
whole
history
of
capitalist
modernity
in
four
months
our
night
out
got
canceled
because
turner
has
what
looks
most
like
scarlet
fever
yes
scarlet
fever
what
is
this
the
1800s
so
he
and
holden
brought
me
flowers
chocolates
a
movie
and
sushi
it
ended
up
being
a
great
night
in
with
the
boys
i
love
this
saturday
please
join
us
from
7
to

great
and
terrible

i
can
not
see

apparently

ever

except
he
was
only
on

what
a
week
our

been
a
little
stressy
these
past

days

going
full
tilt

some
projects
for
work
poor
guy
he
is

much
chained

has
been
walking
around

while

a
maggie

my
competitive
soul
is
not
happy
oh
well
such
is
life
shrug
and
move
on
here's
stupefix
video
celebratory
video
so
my
cousin
was
going
to
the
football
game
with
her
boyfriend
of
12
years
now
then
it
was
11
years
but
i
digress
so
we
were
taking
care
of
her
two
kids
while
they
were
at
the
game
and
before
her
and
her
boyfriend
were
going
to
go
shopping
if
he
did
not
have
to
work
so
it
ended
up
he
had
to
work
so
she
texted
me
asking
if
i
would
go
to
the
family
get
together
if
she
would
and
i
said
whatever
fine
so
my
parents
took
the
older
one
with
them
and
the
boy
and
i
had
the
younger
one
since
had
to
take
a
nap
and
we
chilled
out
while
waiting
for
the
game
to
end
and
her
to
come
over
then
we
went
off
to
my
aunts
house
i
do
not
remember
how
long
we
were
there
exactly
but
it
was
really
weird
and
awkward
one
of
my
cousins
was
and
he
was
trying
to
get
the
youngest
boy
to
come
to
him
and
he
did
not
do
it
which
sort
of
amused
me
but
it
was
really
annoying
to
me
that
he
was
in
the
first
place
anyways
we
were
going
to
have
the
kids
do
their
presents
but
no
one
stayed
in
the
room
and
they
all
went
into
the
other
room
which
was
super
annoying
before
that
grandma
handed
out
cards
with
money
in
them
the
boy
got
one
which
was
good
and
then
the
problem
grandma
left
out
my
cousins
boyfriend
again
see
they
say
they
are
not
racist
but
its
pretty
clear
they
are
and
she
just
gave
one
card
with
some
money
for
my
cousin
and
her
two
boys
well
she
was
stewing
and
then
the
present
thing
did
not
make
anything
better
it
was
pointless
why
we
even
came
we
could
have
had
a
great
time
just
staying
at
the
house
but
we
tried
its
just
never
been
the
same
since
my
great
auntie
died
so
we
were
trying
to
make
the
best
of
it
but
i
went
in
the
other
room
and
they
were
opening
presents
in
there
and
i
was
like
what
the
but
i
was
just
trying
to
give
away
the
ornaments
the
boy
and
i
made
then
my
cousin
blew
up
said
she
was
done
and
well
since
i
was
her
ride
i
was
getting
all
ready
to
leave
then
it
was
a
screaming
match
cussing
all
over
and
my
uncle
telling
her
to
get
out
of
his
house
and
shes
not
welcome
anymore
and
grandma
screaming
that
she
is
not
racist
and
that
he
never
said
thank
you
so
that
s
why
she
was
mad
and
then
my
grandpa
who
was
but
trying
to
keep
the
peace
and
calm
heidi
down
and
my
aunt
who
tries
to
get
into
everyones
business
and
oh
boy
it
was
quite
the
mess
so
we
high
tailed
it
out
there
and
went
back
to
my
house
to
wait
for
everyone
to
come
back
and
then
talk
and
later
my
parents
took
her
and
the
boys
home
but
oh
boy
it
was
a
great
mess
christmas
day
was
good
though
haha
now
do
not
worry
kids
elmo's
more
afraid
of
you
than
you
are
of
him
right
down
the
line
by
gerry
rafferty
that
i
breathe
the
question
i
have
got
is
who
says
that
the
ultimate
metric
of
life
is
how
long
it
is
i
still
do
not
get
that
i'd
argue
that
each
of
us
is
trapped
in
this
thing
we
call
a
body
so
getting
it
to
a
point
where
we
are
comfortable
in
it
for
the
duration
of
our
time
here
is
not
necessarily
a
trivial
or
simply
superficial
thing
and
with
that
day
013
was
finished
this
has
turned
out
to
be
much
longer
than
i
anticipated
and
so
i
will
continue
with
the
other
princesses
later
this
week
and
finally
someone
praised
the
hummus
and
that
was
that
another
year
of
finch's
holiday
time
boutique
whew
we
had
such
a
great
turn
out
thanks
to
everyone
who
attended
purchased
lovely
items
and
to
those
who
made
those
lovely
items
what
a
success
okay
i
lied
about
the
drink
they
were
more
than
willing
to
help
without
bribes
or
begging
involved
taking
the
gist
of
this
tag
from
visha
i
will
continue
to
run
with
you
and
for
you
please
watch
over
me
as
i
train
again
this
spring
and
guide
me
through
to
another
momentous
race
but
maybe
this
time
without
the
achilles
injury
the
most
important
message
is
what
it
does
not
tell
us
it
does
not
tell
us
whether
the
person
who
died
consented
when
the
lethal
dose
was
administered
royal
the
pageant
closes
so
come
on
america
you
know
in
your
hearts
that
i
m
the
best
choice
your
brains
might
disagree
but
those
guys
are
anyway
plus
i
m
from
pennsylvania
just
like
rick
ron
and
newt
so
i
guess
that
means
i
ll
lose
to
romney
this
is
the
chicken
man
he
is
the
most
incredible
butcher
of
poultry
i
have
ever
seen
his
ability
to
de
bone
and
prepare
a
chicken
breast
sotille
very
thin
is
nothing
short
of
mastery
he
was
only
nineteen
years
old
and
yet
he
had
already
made
an
indelible
mark
on
the
world
last
friday
evening
we
lost
dane
his
death
has
paralyzed
our
community
he
was
a
2011
graduate
of
cape
fear
high
school
in
fayetteville
nc
he
was
a
freshman
at
east
carolina
university
this
year
and
he
planned
to
major
in
biology
coming
from
her
nose
you
greedy
gluttonous
sod
i
have
found
a
way
to
prepare
my
heart
for
the
resurrection
of
jesus
though
a
pastor
i
had
in
college
and
who
i
still
keep
up
with
is
doing
at
40
day
challenge
with
her
current
congregation
and
i
have
decided
that
i
will
be
following
along
and
posting
in
here
i
have
already
made
a
page
up
near
the
top
of
this
blog
with
the
40
days
of
topics
listed
out
and
ready
to
go
they
have
got
dates
next
to
them
so
it
will
be
an
exercise
in
staying
current
for
me
to
stay
on
top
of
all
the
topics
oddly
at
the
same
time
as
they
want
to
supposedly
make
it
easier
for
people
to
own
guns
they
also
want
to
increase
the
number
of
people
that
get
put
in
jail
for
all
sorts
of
crimes
this
is
strange
because
the
statistics
that
we
already
have
indicate
that
most
types
of
crime
are
on
the
decrease
the
park
was
so
cute
we
have
many
cute
parks
in
arlington
but
parks
in
the
city
have
different
feels
to
them
for
a
moment
i
daydreamed
about
living
in
d
c
it
struck
me
that
josh
felt
no
embarrassment
or
if
he
did
he
had
no
way
of
showing
it
he
just
seemed
relieved
maybe
refreshed
even

timing
your
eats
around
your
exercise
another
time
this
time
walking
through
the
woods
near
a
battle
site
between
my
cousin's
and
my
ancestors
and
the
encroaching
white
people
i
saw
an
owl
in
a
low
hanging
branch
as
i
was
bounding
down
the
trail
i
noticed
the
tiny
bird
and
stopped
dead
in
my
tracks
so
to
speak
our
eyes
locked
and
i
spoke
to
the
owl
s
he
waited
a
few
moments
and
then
flew
off
the
next
morning
i
was
told
my
grandfather
was
near
death
story

in
laboratory
studies

such
as
a
c
and
e
as
well
as

such
as

and
dithiolthiones
found

and

and

a
good
session
at

therapy
half
a
minute
later
the
ball
found
its
way
into
arsenal
s
goal
yet
again
when
zafuan
s
mental
powers
willed
it
away
from
the
feet
of

travelled

compared
with

i
have
had
no

with

or

disasters
price
wise
it
is
7
65
so
just
over
a
1
saving
again
that
nagging
feeling
it
failed
to
cover
as
many
figures
but
in
fact
out
lasted
the
primer
buy
two
units
given
the
need
to
go
over
the
figures
less
than
with
the
vallejo
leaves
me
thinking
i
am
right
about
the
coverage
being
lower
this
would
mean
the
1
saving
is
eaten
into
with
a
need
to
replace
the
sooner
another
issue
but
one
of
taste
the
matt
finish
is
more
satin
than
true
matt
which
for
some
is
a
plus
point
but
if
you
want
flat
matt
this
is
probably
not
your
spray
i
remember
reading
that
when
the
writer
tracey
chevalier
had
her
first
baby
someone
told
her
that
every
baby
costs
one
book
she
said
something
to
the
effect
that
that
seemed
fair
enough
but
we
should
turn
connolly's
equation
upside
down
and
say
that
maybe
what
is
in
the
pram
breathing
vulnerable
life
hope
a
present
responsibility
is
actually
more
important
than
good
art
it
might
make
us
produce
less
art
but
maybe
it
would
be
art
with
the
future
at
its
heart
i
remember
one
day
missing
bear
so
bad
i
sat
on
the
floor
of
her
room
curled
in
a
ball
holding
her
baby
blanket
just
sobbing
the
kind
where
you
feel
like
you
are
going
to
puke
all
her
toys
were
starting
to
collect
dust
and
life
seemed
on
pause
when
children
are
kidnapped
or
die
young
i
don
t
completely
understand
but
i
have
an
idea
of
what
that
parent
goes
through
life
on
pause
i
just
needed
to
feel
the
weight
of
her
in
my
arms
trace
her
chubby
fingers
with
mine
breathe
her
in
whisper
in
her
ear
i
was
trying
everything
for
her
dustin
came
home
from
work
to
find
me
there
he
just
sat
next
to
me
and
started
silently
crying
he
didn
t
break
down
often
but
he
did
that
night
we
sat
there
for
a
long
time
surrounded
by
smiling
pooh
and
tigger
as
the
sun
set
just
sobbing
a
23
yr
old
and
24
yr
old
just
trying
to
tackle
the
worst
case
scenario
this
might
sound
easy
but
when
you
consider
that
craft
has
21
keg
pumps
and
16
cask
pumps
i
could
end
up
getting
er
wrecked
i
spent
most
of
my
career
designing
building
and
marketing
computer
software
after
retiring
i
needed
a
creative
outlet
a
few
years
ago
i
discovered
mixed
media
collage
and
it
s
been
a
love
affair
ever
since
if
you'd
like
to
join
us
it
is
only
400
euros
for
two
days
now
there
is
a
bargain
since
my
new
job
requires
a
bus
ride
to
work
i
have
found
myself
getting
much
more
reading
done
lately
and
as
my
read
pile
gets
a
little
larger
i
realize
it
is
time
to
get
rid
of
some
of
the
books
on
my
bookshelves
seat
salt
and
ground

i
see
these

of
beers
and
wonder
if
their
contents
are
somehow
made
up
of
factory
rejects
and
product
that
s
past
its
shelf
life
i
don
t
know
that
i
ve
ever
purchased
one
of
these
variety
theme
packs
myself
but
my
dear
bride
brings
them
home
to
me
from
time
to
time
and
i
ve
recently
determined
that
by
and
large
the
contents
are
usually
of
good
quality
and
within
their
reasonable
shelf
life
based
mainly
on
my
having
checked
a
few
of
the
beers
that
actually
have
dates
on
them
with
this
in
mind
i
suppose
i

be

nuts

you

they

i

been
eagerly
following
the
building
of
the

since
its
creation
was
announced
two
years
ago
this
brand
new
american
national
service
organization
modelled
in
part
on
the
peace
corps
was
launched
last
month
and
50
enthusiastic
and
motivated
young
people
it
was
apparently
harder
to
get
a
spot
in
the
foodcorps
than
at
harvard
spanned
out
across
41
sites
and
10
states
to
improve
nutrition
education
for
kids
develop
school
garden
projects
and
change
what
s
on
school
lunch
trays
service
members
work
in
already
established
organizations
and
the
focus
is
on
areas
of
the
country
with
the
highest
rates
of
childhood
obesity
and
the
least
access
to
healthy
food
everything
else
can
wait
i
am
growing
a
human
after
all
and
whenever
i
add
that
to
my
mental

accomplishments

always
feel
much

bought

we
also
continue
to
follow
a
stronger
portrayal
of
erik
than
is
generally
encountered
he
emerges
as
more
dignified
more
of
a
credible
character
despite
his
backward
looking
music
though
erik
may
be
no
revolutionary
here
and
in
the
preceding
act
especially
upon
the
words
satan
hat
dich
umgarnt
he
presents
us
not
only
with
a
plausible
alternative
morality
to
either
of
the
production
s
two
principal
worlds
but
also
with
true
deeply
felt
anger
through
marco
jentzsch
s
finely
judged
not
quite
heroic
portrayal
he
may
be
romantic
rather
than
romantic

he
is
no

it
is

times

the

close

while
i
agree
with
josh
that
college
administrators
capture
and
waste
a
larger
portion
of
the
rents
and
that
the
withdrawal
of
state
support
dramatically
increased
the
economic
load
of

ed
for
non
wealthy
families
i
cannot
come
anywhere
close
to
agreeing
with
the
last
couple
sentences
of
the
quoted
portion
i
saw
a
t
shirt
today
and
i
immediately
had
to
have
it
i
felt
that
it
accurately
represented
my
appreciation
for
sandwiches
my
lack
of
any
understanding
of
style
and
as
an
added
bonus
it
seemed
to
imply
an
appropriate
amount
of
street
cred
for
a
software
engineer
that
wears
shirts
that
express
an
appreciation
for
sandwiches
on
wednesday
our
internet
cut
off
i
nearly
cried
but
i
found
other
ways
to
occupy
myself
anyway
went
out
to
lunch
with
my
granny
in
holywood
went
to
a
place
called
the
duck
which
despite
the
name
is
lovely
if
a
tad
expensive
had
really
nice
oak
smoked
haddock
after
that
we
had
a
walk
around
the
shops
in
holywood
saw
a
few
cute
places
with
things
i
want
to
buy
a
few
places
i'd
like
to
take
jake
and
had
a
hunt
for
something
to
get
my
mum
for
her
birthday
next
weekend
was
a
really
lovely
day
but
jesus
changed
all
that
the
stitches
go
through
half
the
thickness
of
the
outsole
then
come
up
through
the
uppers
the
insole
is
pasted
in
around
the
front
but
stitched
to
the
heel
cover
in
back
those
tapered
edges
are
trimmed
and
pushed
up
to
blend
into
the
upper
latter
think
of
all
the
new
majors
think

i
called
first
this
morning
at
10
am
i
called

i
was
not
connected
to
anyone
and
the
line
just
rang
and
rang
and
rang
so
i
called
back
4
more
times
same
thing
just
rings
and
rings
so
i
called
again
and
pressed
3
for
the
geek
squad
got
to
a
live
person
and
they
connected
me
to
appliances
the
phone
just
rang
and
rang
and
rang
so
i
called
back
same
thing
for
a
half
hour
no
one
answered
the
phone
so
i
tweeted
twelpforce
again
sure
enough
they
got
through
to
the
store
i
tried
again
no
answer
i
finally
got
through
to
a
live
person
after
40
minutes
which
i
am
seething
about
because
that
is
just
poor
customer
service
wait
that
is
not
even
customer

how
do
they
operate
a

if
no
one
answers
the

you
would
naturally
espect
that
countries
like
italy
and
spain
with
their
soft

atheist

populations
would
soon
fall
for
this
sort
of
protesting

not

but
it
is
only
a
matter

saddest
of
all
is
the
news
that
even
in

they
have
a

this
is
the
sort
of
thing
you
can
see
and
hear
if
you
go
to
the

in
dublin
is
a
big
disgrace
i
am
mortified
i
think
i
am
so
very
honored
privileged
to
be
given
an
opportunity
to
be
a
guest
designer
on
sundays
with

crissy

creates
such
beautiful

one
of
which
is
this
little
sweetie
called

a

the
theme
for
october
at
sundays
with
crissy
is
thanks
or
thanksgiving
so
i
thought
what
better
way
to
say
thanks
than
to
offer
up
a
sweet
prayer
thank
you
for
being
you
this
could
be
to
a
dear
friend
or
as
a
special
thank
you

holidays
teeny

wishes
cl
i
do
think
that
there
is
a
lack
of
gender
discourse
in
sound
arts
i
m
not
entirely
sure
why
this
is
but
i
suspect
that
it
is
largely
because
sound
arts
could
still
be
said
to
be
an
emergent
discipline
so
up
until
very
recently
it
has
been
largely
concerned
with
trying
to
trace
its
lineage
and
mark
out
its
territory
or
set
its
boundaries
very
broadly
more
recently
the
discourse
has
extended
into
the
details
of
areas
of
practice
but
i
think
there
is
probably
about
to
be
a
large
expansion
in
the
way
that
sound
arts
are
practiced
viewed
and
talked
about
if
we
learn
to
accept
the
will
of
the
situation
we
find
ourselves
in
the
church
we
are
called
to
and
the
marriage
that
we
are
bound
to
and
we
not
only
accept
it
but
embrace
his
will
we
will
find
that
the
mundane
becomes
something
far
greater
eating
the
same
old
thing
becomes
an
opportunity
to
give
thanks
to
our
lord
for
his
continual
provision
that
job
now
is
a
blessing
undeserved
through
which
provides
not
only
what
we
need
but
what
we
enjoy
too
our
churches
become
venues
to
minister
to
others
rather
than
just
taking
from
others
marriage
and
family
become
the
practice
field
for
learning
s
character
love
and
your
need
for
his
grace
all
the
things
that
are
so
mundane
become
glorious
when
we
embrace
the
lord
and
see
things
his
way
rather
than
our
way
instead
of
for
things
to
change
we
should
desire
and
pursue
the
transformation
of
our
own
character
desires
and
ambitions
we
need
to
go
from
a
selfish
outlook
to
one
of
a
servant
saved
by
grace
when
we
realize
how
great
our
is
and
how
deep
and
wide
his
love
for
us
is
we
can
t
help
but
be
content
and
when
we
learn
contentment
from
being
more
like
christ
all
of
that
adds
up
to
a
gloriously
profound
life
no
matter
how
dreary
the
circumstance
contentment
with
godliness
is
the
recipe
for
a
fulfilling
and
satisfying

holy
trinity
iron

when
it
comes
to
the
avengers
captain
america
thor
and
iron
man
are
the
3
big
dogs
they
re
not
always
all
on
the
team
at
the
same
time
but
when
they
are
that
is
when
you
know
you
have
the
real
deal
sometimes
months
pass
where
you
have
a
team
of
say
iron
man
dr
druid
yellowjacket
jacosta
rage
and
jack
of
hearts
and
you
re
just
thinking
why
the
am
i
reading
about
one
cool
character
surrounded
by
this
gang
of
losers
not
to
say
those
losers
can
t
make
for
interesting
characters
but
the
avengers
book
in
the
past
has
strayed
a
little
too
far
from
its
roots
as
marvel
s
premiere
super
team
a
little
too
often
once
you
ve
got
the
trinity
together
then
you
can
pad
the
team
with
whatever
other
wankers
you
want
and
it
ll
still
make
for
a
good
read
a
few
years
ago
writer
brian
michael
bendis
took
a
hard
look
at
the
avengers
and
realized
the
team
was
comprised
mostly
of
b
list
characters
who
couldn
t
support
a
title
of
their
own
so
what
place
did
they
have
on
the
avengers
he
noted
that
dc
comics
has
their
justice
league
which
is
comprised
of
all
of
their
biggest
and
best
known
heroes
like
superman
batman
wonder
woman
green
lantern
flash
aquaman
etc
so
why
shouldn
t
the
avengers
be
marvel
s
equivalent
to
that
he
destroyed
the
team
in
a
storyline
called
avengers
disassembled
where
many
of
the
b
listers
were
killed
including
hawkeye
vision
antman
and
jack
of
hearts
don
t
worry
most
of
them
are
better
now
bendis
then
rebuilt
the
team
from
the
ground
up
in
a
newly
launched
title
called
the
new
avengers
this
team
included
capt
and
iron
man
and
i
m
sure
would
have
included
thor
had
he
been
alive
at
the
time
in
an
unorthodox
move
bendis
also
added
a
couple
of
marvel
s
other
signature
characters
who
seemed
to
have
no
place
on
the
avengers
wolverine
and
spider
man
this
roster
change
resulted
in
the
avenger
s
becoming
marvel
s
top
selling
book
for
the
first
time
in
decades
this
move
worked
in
getting
me
to
read
the
avengers
book
on
a
regular
basis
which
i
had
never
done
before
bendis
has
remained
on
the
book
ever
since
and
has
expanded
the
line
i
now
buy
a
half

avengers

report

learn
that
lennie
loves
to
pet
small
soft
things
including
a
dead
mouse
he
has
hidden
in
his
pocket
and
that
they
were

run
out

you
out
here
a
bit
when
looking
for

laptop
you
can
really
never
go
wrong
with
a
brand
that
specifically
makes
laptops
for
gamers
alienware
and
msi
come
to
mind
as
they
release
high
performance
models
that
are
custom
built
to
withstand
the
immense
performance
required
by
current
games
these
purpose
built
rigs
work
great
at
the
aspects
that
gamers
need
them
to
run
at
namely
graphics
and
processing
speeds
this
takes
us
to
the
next
thing
that
we
want
to
share
with
you
when
it
comes
to
getting
the
best
out
there
the
purpose
of
a
gaming
rig
is
to
process
the
huge
amounts
of
data
that
games
have
this
means
that
they
need
a
very
fast
processor
a
large
amount
of
ram
and
a
high
performance
video
card
to
handle
the
graphics
data
that
make
games
as
realistic
as
possible
lineage
thanks
for
reading
and
we
hope
to
see
you
at
the
new
blog
let
us
know
you
stopped
by
the
marvellous
display
no
wonder
the
books
sold
out
i
was
tempted
to
buy
one
myself
generally
you
do
not
have
as
a
style
rich
to
accomplish
as
well
as
wristband
for
all
cars
or
trucks
there
is
no
reason
why
terriers
should
not
have
been
at
least
a
modest
success
and
attempts
to
figure
out
why
it
instead
became
one
of
the
new
season's
lowest
rated
shows
have
concentrated
on
the
s
how
is
title
and
what
was
apparently
a
confusing
publicity
campaign
that
led
some
potential
viewers
to
conclude
that
this
was
a
show
about
dog
fighting
to
my
mind
however
the
problem
is
much
simpler
terriers
has
no
hook
for
just
about
every
series
that
i
love
and
quite
a
few
that
i
do
not
care
for
i
could
come
up
with
a
single
sentence
that
encapsulates
what
the
show
does
well
and
why
it
is
worth
watching
the
good
wife
has
the
best
female
characters
on
tv
dexter
actually
gets
how
to
maintain
a
moral
distance
from
a
sympathetic
character's
immoral
actions
glee
has
sue
sylvester
if
i
had
to
come
up
with
a
one
sentence
pitch
for
terriers
the
best
i
could
do
would
be
it
is
really
good
which
is
as
true
as
it
is
unpersuasive
when
twop
recapped
the
series
pilot
they
likened
terriers
to
veronica
mars
which
i
think
gets
at
the
heart
of
why
this
show
is
unsellable
if
veronica
mars
is
southern
california
set
noir
with
a
twist
that
the
main
character
is
a
teenager
girl
and
the
s
how
is
action
takes
place
in
a
high
school
terriers
is
veronica
mars
without
that
twist
just
plain
old
southern
california
set
noir
my
reaction
to
the
pilot
meanwhile
was
that
it
was
well
done
but
familiar
and
though
i
am
glad
i
stuck
with
the
show
i
think
that
this
was
an
accurate
assessment
there
was
never
anything
new
or
original
about
terriers
no
standout
quality
to
the
show
it
was
simply
very
good
in
almost
every
respect
the
stories
both
standalone
and
season
long
the
characters
the
dialogue
and
though
this
is
both
admirable
and
sadly
unusual
it
is
also
very
hard
to
sell
this
year
let
s
try
and
push
the
envelope
and
maybe
win
some
awards
and
the
last
one
i
just
turned
my
head
every
10
seconds
if
you
look
closely
you
can
see
my
ear
right
under
my
eye
to
date
the
group
has
charted
17
singles
onto
the
billboard
top
40
charts
instead
of
making
a
200

movie
and
kind
of
betting
the
farm
on
one
character

can

the
clutter
has
spilt
over
into
my
life
i
have
not
been
eating
properly
not
planning
meals
so
therefore
when
it
comes
time
to
cooking
dinner
i
do
not
have
the
ingredients
and
just
end
up
whipping
up
something
easy
and
not
very
exciting
i
love
to
cook
but
with
my
disorganised
life
i
do
not
have
time
for
cooking
at
the
moment
a
year
ago
i
had
plenty
of
time
to
cook
i
would
bake
often
my
son
would
come
home
from
school
and
i
would
whip
up
a
cake
or
cupcakes
or
brownies
for
he
and
his
friends
but
i
do
not
do
any
of
that
at
the
moment
due
to
my
disorganisation
and
my
kitchen
clutter
my
laundry
seems
to
pile
up
and
up
and
up
and
needs
to
be
organised
and
put
away
i
am
drowning
in
clutter
and
disorganisation
and
i
can
not
stand
it
knowing
what
blogging
platform
is
best
for
you
is
f'ing
hard
rip
tissue
paper
into
small
pieces
we
celebrated
at
dinner
with
one
of
cecilia
s
favorites
steamed
mussels
and
glasses
of
wine
i
prepared
the
mussels
with
an
italian
sauce
and
served
over
bowls
of
linguine
the
meal
was
completed
with
chopped
green
salad
with
balsamic
vinaigrette
and
hot
french
rolls
for
dessert
we
had
key
lime
pie
from
publix
s
a
nice
ending
to
a
special
day
we
were
so
happy
to
have
cecilia
for
a
visit
still
cool
and
a
bit
damp
but
i
know
it
will
heat
up
again
soon
tactics
as
auxiliary
gunner
the
firing
range
of
the
weapon
is
a
little
better
than
the
opposing
number
on
the
scorpion
but
the
bolts
are
quite
weak
and
inaccurate
at
long
range
due
to
their
obvious
colours
useful
to
indicate
to
the
main
gunner
where
bad
guys
are
at
03
moby
so
as
you
can
see
i
came
up
with
some
cute
non
4
legged
animals
but
if
you
really
think
about
it
it
is
not
easy
to
come
up
with
many
we
did
discussed
dolphins
but
i
do
not
know
if
i
really
consider
them
to
be
cute
the
pink
amazon
river
dolphins
are
just
plain
scary
and
i
suppose
the
typical
bottle
nose
dolphin
can
be
kind
of
be
cute
but
i
usually
have
to
want
to
snuggle
something
before
i
will
consider
it
truly
cute
i
do
not
want
to
snuggle
a
dolphin
and
i
actually
would
be
terrified
to
swim
with
one
because
i
could
not
even
snorkel
in
a
goldfish
bowl
without
freaking
out
over
the
fish
being
near
me
in
the
water
i
have
been
to
hawaii
twice
and
panicked
at
the
sight
of
even
the
smallest
fish
both
times
when
i
attempted
snorkeling
along
the
shore
i
am
quite
a
i
prefer
urban
snorkeling
aka
going
to
an
aquarium
or
designers
or
just
they
are
that
just
want
to
make
some
noise
in

for

shoot
a
man
to
death
in
his
car
momma
and
i
went
down
to
visit
my
niece
her
granddaughter
b
last
week
it
was
a
nice
drive
with
great
company
something
we
normally
don
t
get
to
do
together
b
was
unhinged
from
a
recent
breakup
and
stress
from
upcoming
finals
it
was
a
crazy
wild
visit
it
was
absolutely
exhausting
but
so
good
to
see
everyone
it
had
been
many
months
since
my
last
visit
i
watched
billy
the
exterminator
yesterday
through
the
blur
of
nausea
have
you
seen
him
he
is
pretty
cartoonish
but
entertaining
if
your
deathly
ill
and
have
no
strength
to
think
i
turned
off
the
one
where
he
exterminated
bed
bugs
that
was
way
too
gross
for
me
mostly
he
rounds
up
gators
and
snakes
i
am
sure
you
will
be
turning
over
to
a
e
to
watch
him
immediately
wink
so
my
first
item
sold
for
about
70
of
what
i
retail
it
for
not
great
but
not
bad
i
had
to
wait
til
that
one
sold
til
i
could
schedule
another
one
when
you
are
new
and
until
you
build
your
reputation
you
can
only
list
one
lot
at
a
time
seems
fair
as
they
do
not
want
scam
sellers
there
but
believe
me
it
is
an
eternity
waiting
for
your
item
to
come
up
and
to
be
able
to
get
a
slot
for
the
next
one
lol
peace
is
within
you
right
now
basic
cheap
cafe
in
a
related
story
i
had
an
exterminator
come
to
my
house
tuesday
after
members
of
my
family
saw
several
large
roaches
on
our
deck
it
was
feared
by
some
that
the
two
inch
long
palmetto
bugs
could
make
their
way
inside
our
home
but
i
m
from
miami
and
am
not
afraid
of
creepy
intruders
we
used
to
have
giant
poison
african
toads
in
our
backyard
we
killed
em
by
pounding
em
with
the
back
sides
of
shovels
didn
t
need
no
stinkin
permit
how
are
you
affected
by
holding
in
your
desires
my
friend
advertised
that
she'd
found
a
cat
but
after
receiving
no
queries
she
finally
allowed
herself
to
believe
that
this
chaka
was
to
be
her
baby
it
can
be
argued
that
we
are
seeing
a
similar
moral
inexactitude
in
relation
to
the
iraq
war
where
senior
government
ministers
including
the
prime
minister
will
happily
ignore
the
advice
of
experienced
international
lawyers
at
the
foreign
office
in
favour
of
the
shifting
sands
views
of
the
attorney
general
lord
bingham
a
former
lord
chief
justice
stated
the
other
day
that
in
his
view
a
view
shared
by
many
lawyers
the
iraq
war
was
illegal
never
was
it
more
clear
the
distinction
between
doves
and
hawks
but
in
this
case
the
hawks
appear
to
be
prepared
to
ignore
the
existence
of
international
law
because
the
law
is
finely
balanced
and
more
important
there
is
no
court
to
determine
the
issue
it
seems
that
we
are
also
prepared
to
compromise
our
ethico
moral
and
legal
position
in
relation
to
torture
by
being
complicit
in
the
activities
of
american
military
torturers
not
too
shabby
a
mantra
thankfulness
creates
that
which
brings
you
whatever
you
seek
thankfulness
is
the
cause
and
not
the
result
of
a
pleasant
experience
thankfulness
is
one
of
the
two
most
powerful
feelings
that
a
human
heart
can
tolerate
they
are
each
the
two
sides
of
the
same
coin
panic
is
the
belief
that
i
have
nothing
thankfulness
is
the
knowledge
that
i
have
everything
both
bags
have
a
lotv
topper
and
sentiment
and
leftover
papers
from
my
stash

remember
to
follow
up
at
the
end
of
every
conversation
make
sure
you
get
a
business
card
from
those
who
you
talked
to
and
even
those
who
you
weren
t
able
to
this
will
be
a
good
way
to
follow
up
with
them
if
you
wanted
to
have
a
conversation
but
there
wasn
t
enough
time
ask
them
what
the
best
way
to
contact
them
would
be
some
people
like
phone
email
or
even
social
media
such
as
linkedin
get
in
touch
within
48
hours
to
ensure
they
remember
who
you
were
and
remind
them
of
the
conversation
you
had
the
enormity
and
sickness
of
this
abuse
is
shown
by
the
example
of
a
street
in
a
yorkshire
town
in
which
all
the
residents
are
exclusively
pakistani
women
with
children
living
on
social
security
this
is
nothing
new
way
back
in
bradford
muslim
landlords
and
other
muslim
businessmen
were
renowned
for
abusing
and
using
a
system
to
which
they
had
no
loyalty
or
respect
and
then
he
asked
me
why
the
sky
is
blue
no
wars
on
monday
i
will
be
returning
to
work

hopefully
this
time
it
will
not
be
so
hellish
i
will
be
working
in
the
high
powered
glamorous
world
of
medical
billing
and

i
suspect
it
is
going
to
be
so
boring
i
will
find
myself
fantasizing
about
algorithms
most
afternoons
but
it
is
a
good
company
to
work
for

mon
through

sure
beats
60
plus

in

everything
is
just

i

i

that
my

it

spraying

it

i
just
could
not
waste
a

day
on

so
i
did
it
anyway
i
ended
up
have
to
vacuum
the

out
a
couple
times
and
picking
some

out
of

since

i
cut
off

she
spent
a

an

drizzling
vinegar

watching

when

i
purposely
gave
her
primary
colors
to
work
with
when
she
declared
she
was
done
i
handed
her
a
spoon
poured
some
of
the
remaining
vinegar
into

tub
and
let
her
experiment
with
stirring
and
mushing
the
mixture

what

to

i
m
asked
sometimes
is
mitt
romney
conservative
enough
and
my
answer
is
simple
compared
to
barack
obama
you
know
this
is
not
a
choice
between
mitt
romney
and
ronald
reagan
this
is
a
choice
between
mitt
romney
and
the
most
radical
leftist
president
in
american
history

why
is
that
well
part
of
the
reason
might
be
that
this
is
book
four
in
the
bridgerton
family
series
and
there
might
be
an
assumption
that
the
reader
might
already
know
the

the
basic
romance

i
point
this
out
so
you
can
keep
it
in
mind
when
writing
romance
copy
for

you

tanya

i
think
she
s
right
what
s
unquestionably
certain
for
me
however
is
that
when
i
began
looking
for
the
lesson
in
life
s
experiences
my
reactions
toward
life
particularly
the
tougher
parts
took
a
dramatic
turn
for
the
better
i
m
not
suggesting
you
and
i
should
lay
down
and
just
let
life
roll
over
us
and
neither
am
i
suggesting
you
gloss
over
evil
and
injustice
as
if
it
s
necessary
for
the
service
of
some
grander
purpose
i
m
only
suggesting
that
you
join
me
in
the
practice
of
acceptance
we
are
taught
to
resist
what
is

all
you

repent

if
you
don

repent

who
sent
me
this
shout
out
big
love
to

state
we
left
for
st
george
early
thursday
morning
it
was
dark
and
rainy
when
we
left
grand
terrace
i
went
with
my
parents
sydney
michael
kaidee
cole
and
paisley
darian
was
coming
up
later
with
chase
garrett
and
chloe
darian
had
to
teach
his
class
and
the
kids
had
their
state
testing
what
skrebowski
offers
is
a
sound
rejoinder
to
those
economists
who
say
that
peak
oil
theorists
do
not
take
into
account
economic
factors
factors
which
those
economists
say
will
solve
the
problem
of
peak
oil
whenever
it
arrives
by
destroying
demand
and
making
substitutes
profitable
for
now
however
we
can
see
that
the
economic
factors
are
not
really
solving
the
problem
of
peak
oil
but
possibly
feeding
it
that
is
not
something
most
economists
will
be
able
to
hear
and
it
describes
a
pattern
that
will
likely
only
confuse
the
public
and
policymakers
even
though
skrebowski
has
explained
it
in
terms
that
any
thoughtful
person
can
understand
if
only
they
want
to
to
be
let
into
the
car
eventually
we
went
to
camp
authorities
and
said
we
needed
longer
distances
to
run
we
somehow
got
permission
to
run
to
town
and
back
which
we
did
about
three
times
a
week
though
sometimes
we
hitched
back
instead
the
six
of
us
piled

right
after

charles
was
taken
in
by
madison
and
madison
they
aren
t
related
it
just
so
happened
they
had
the
same
last
name
he
started
at
the
bottom
of
madison
and
madison
slowly
working
his
way
to
the
top
the
air
was
always
fresher
at
the
top
he
mused
one
day
as
he
entered
his
office
there
was
no
one
there
charles
loved
coming
in
before
everyone
else
today
was
no
different
oddly
enough
he
could
hear
the
ticking
of
a
clock
it
didn
t
really
bother
him
at
first
but
when
everyone
started
coming
in
the
ticking
wouldn
t
stop
i
must
be
going
crazy
he
thought
just
for
a
moment
before
the
daily
meeting
started
it
did
not

always
grateful
that
anyone
takes
the
time
to
read
what
i
have

and
when
they
also
take
the
time
to
comment
well
that
is
just
an
added
bonus
of
course
i
would
love
it
if
everyone
simply
agreed
with
everything
i
say
but
if
everyone
agreed
with
me
the
world
would
be
a
very
weird
place
and
i
would
have
nothing
to
write
about
so
as
much
as
i
love
the
feedback
that
supports
my
views
i
also
love
the
feedback
that
challenges
me

this

and
came

with
things
i
did

and
could
not

walk

i
mean
are
you
kidding
me
lol
the
point
of
this
discussion
is
to
emphasize
the
value
of
opposition
as
well
as
the
discernment
to
distinguish
between
the
good
and
the
bad
simply
abstaining
from
all
forms
of
aggression
is
not
the
answer
and
inevitably
develops
into
a
failure
to
relate
to
society
life
is
challenging
taking
away
that
natural
development
is
hazardous
to
early
development
and
is
not
naturally
remedied
in
the
complexities
of
adulthood
if
we
as
a
society
desire
to
cultivate
mature
and
well
rounded
adults
we
shouldn
t
be
so
quick
to
shelter
them
from
the
value
of
opposition

again

again
it
did
not

your

is
as
graceful
as
a

gliding
across
a

it
is
not
simple
my
friends
who
grew
up
here
handle
it
better
but
we
were
at
a
dinner
party
recently
and
i
was
chatting
to
an
ethiopian
woman
in
her
late
twenties
now
why
would
i
have
the
need
to
state
the
obvious
you
ask
because
those
are
easy
words
to
mouth
but
much
harder
to
get
those
things
into
my
heart
i
m
not
him
aaaaaaarrrrggghhh
i
m
not
him
and
the
worst
part
is
i
know
that
i
ll
probably
continue
to
struggle
with
his
simple
truth
why
because
i
m
totally
guilty
of
being
proud
proud
in
the
ugliest
ways
lucifer
was
proud
and
we
all
know
how
that
turned
out
not
a
good
scene
not
a
good
outcome
ok
so
i
know
that
other
parents
have
this
same
issue
and
it
s
to
be
expected
when
you
work
from
home
with
small

there
s

we
ended
the
trip
with
a
great
family
style
meal
at
barrel
and
that
is
how
it
should
have
ended
a
family
style
meal
because
we
are
family
i
am
so
glad
that
i
had
the
opportunity
to
get
to
know
the
people
that
i
went
on
this
trip
with
more
than
i
already
did
i
hope
to
get
to
hang
out
with
them
more
than
i
did
before
we
went
they
are
some
great
people
after
god's
heart
what
exactly
does
a
library
grandparent
do
i
asked
bewildered
they
wrote
this
paean
to
male
adolescent
fantasies
but
beggars
can
t
be
choosy
at
least
they
pay
on
time
if
you
don
t
like
the
price
you
re
gonna
get
then
you
have
the
option
to
decline
the
project
and
i
have
been
doing
that
for
months
now
funny
because
they
would
even
call
me
using
agents
who
first
tried
to
talk
to
me
with
american
slang
as
if
i
don
t
know
that
they
re
filipinos
like
me
so
i
talk
to
them
in
my
native
tongue
and
has
been
consistently
telling
them
i
m
busy
right
now
send
me
projects
next
week
what
is
your
most
amusing
or
interesting
live
gig
backstage
tour
experience
before
i
toss
those
old
mss
into
the
flames
there
is
one
other
consideration
some
of
this
earlier
work
is
pretty
good
and
i
would
like
to
see
it
out
there
again
the
first
challenge
of
each
month
will
be
a
guest
designer
search
honour
and
truth
old
fashioned
words
i
picture
something
it
s
i
m
not
advising
anyone
to
dress
like
a
stripper
or
in
anything
they
are
not
comfortable
with
everyone
has
to
know
themselves
and
what
their
best
features
are
but
that
applies
at
any
age
i
do
think
the
whole
mutton
dressed
as
lamb
thing
gets
taken
to
a
demeaning
intimidating
and
catty
extreme
it
pits
women
against
each
other
and
doesn
t
contribute
to
a
healthy
body
image
for
women
as
they
get
older
it
took
mere
seconds
for
me
to
realize
that
my
relief
was
only
partially
warranted
mike
daisey
exaggerated
many
of
the
details
in
his
story
and
this
american
life
should
not
have
run
it
without
thorough
fact
checking
but
the
inhumane
working
conditions
that
daisey
described
have
been
verified
by
the
new
york
times
the
bbc
cnn
and
the
guardian
i
ve
seen
the
photos
of
the
employee
dorms
and
the
suicide
nets
it
s
real
and
i
m
still
a

not

if

i
have
a
few
amused
quibbles
with
what
we
heard
of
the
new
book
and
from
what
winterson
read
i
think
i
prefer
the
fiction
version
 
oranges
 
she
read
a
passage
in
which
her
adoptive
mother
accuses
her
of
coming
from
 
the
wrong
crib
 
a
crib
guarded
the
devil
and
makes
fun
of
the
literalness
of
such
a
notion
yet
winterson's
depiction
of
 
mrs
winterson
 
which
strains
for
comedy
that
lots
of
the
audience
appreciated
but
i
could
not
in
fact
presents
her
as
some
kind
of
devil
which
here
seems
like
a
mistake
but
is
richly
ambiguous
in
the
fiction
version
and
while
we
are
on
the
subject
of

i
have
started
a

they
highly
trained
professionals
the
soprano
alto
tenor
and
bass
satb
were
dressed
in
dapper
outfits
which
along
with
their
positioning
reflected
an
air
of
superiority
compared
to
their
team
the
hackney
singers
lewisham
choral
society
and
forest
philharmonic
came
together
yet
religion
is
patriarchal
and
the
satb
replicated
the
power
that
religion
demands
although
many
would
disagree
the
soprano
s
red
shoes
among
a
stage
in
black
and
white
gave
a
sinister
feel
to
the
godly
image
furthermore
when
the
all
in
black
choir
rose
to
sing
it
depicted
rows
of
dark
angels
wow
how
do
i
even
being
this
post
okay
starting
out
a
little
warning
this
is
my
blog
and
i
have
a
right
to
share
personal
information
on
here
this
is
my
blog
and
i
am
choosing
to
write
something
very
personal
an
account
of
probably
one
of
the
worst
days
of
my
entire
life
i
am
not
doing
this
for
pity
or
out
of
anger
with
the
lord
i
am
doing
this
so
i
can
personally
keep
an
account
of
a
major
struggle
we
went
through
and
hopefully
encourage
others
if
they
have
been
through
or
will
go
through
something
similar
i
pray
this
on
no
one
let
me
tell
you
this
in
advance
this
is
terrible
and
terrible
things
happen
to
all
of
us
through
these
trials
we
are
strengthened
eventhough
it
has
only
been
about
24
hours
i
am
releasing
the
outcomes
to
and
i
have
full
faith
he
will
restore
me
and
my
husband
and
will
allow
us
to
be
ever
so
blessed
in
the
future
all
that
aside
let
me
begin
masculinity
versus
femininity
i
am
subbing
one
right
now
but
with
little
success
it
is
a
story
i
wrote
a
few
years
ago
and
have
edited
fiercely
because
over
the
years
i
have
learned
a
lot
about
how
to
write
the
early
versions
were
pretty
terrible
so
much
so
that
blush
to
think
i
actually
sent
it
out
no
wonder
it
came
back
like
a
rocket
agents
and
editors
should
have
flamed
it
i
like
to
have
things
wrapped
up
and
having
that
mg
novel
out
there
would
make
me
feel
i'd
accomplished
what
i
set
out
to
do
musically
it
sounds
like
a
mix
of
uriah
heep

and
early

opera
this
morning
was
much
better
than
yesterday
s
class
my
body
was
far
more
cooperative
and
it
felt
so
so
good
to
stretch
this
morning
the
class
was
with
a
teacher
i
ve
never
had
before
it
is
great
to
have
the
opportunity
to
take
class
with
various
teachers
at
yoga
vida
experiencing
their
different
styles
of
teaching
and
what
their
trade
marks
are
todays
class
had
a
whole
lotta
chatarungas
i
might
be
a
freak
because
i
love
me
some
chaturanga
but
wow
doing
a
lot
of
them
at
the
beginning
of

would
you
personally
like
to
change
about

firstly
i
want
to
thank
everyone
who
contributed
so
much
you
guys
made
this
project
a
success
pamela
g
so
imagine
my
delight
this
evening
when
my
wife
presented
me
with
a
surprise
gift
a
waterproof
notebook
it
can
be
written
in
using
pen
or
pencil
and
it
will
survive
any
soaking
brilliant
but
the
words
they
say
rankle
and
rankle
knocking
about
in
my
head
with
a
knife
to
my
throat
i
never
forget
what
they
said
or
how
those
words
make
me
feel
mugabe's
and
mswati's
authoritarian
actions
bear
striking
similarities
both
spring
is
here
in
the
midwest
and
this
baroque
aria
could
not
resonate
more
with
me
prior
to
moving
here
i
used
to
read
the
text
for
this
beautiful
aria
by
giovanni
battista
bononcini
and
laugh
to
me
it
seemed
overly
romantic
and
even
peculiar
sine
it
is
in
essence
a
love
song
to
a
tree
bonocinni
used
in
his
1694
opera
serse
and
unfortunately
does
not
serve
a
particularly
meaningful
purpose
to
enhance
the
drama
of
the
plotline
it
does
however
give
the
audience
a
pretty
tune
to
listen
to
at
the
beginning
of
the
opera
but
that
for
the
time
being
is
beside
the
point
apparently
the
piece
was
quite
popular
thereafter
in
fact
i
once
heard
a
story
that
georg
fredrich
haendel
was
so
taken
with
this
particular
melody
and
text
that
he
rearranged
the
piece
for
in
his
own
version
of
the
same
opera
in
1738
when
one
compares
the
two
pieces
it
is
quite
easy
to
hear
the
similarities
fruits
of
false
experiences
another
devilish
trick
humans
employ
is
to
tell
you
something
that
sounds
like
a
tall
story
which
turns
out
to
be
true
a
few
days
ago
the
manager
of
the
safari
camp
asked
me
if
i
d
been
invited
to
the
monkey
wedding
in

hollywood

just
let
me
know

so
today

a
simple
question
if

forced
to

his

does
jeremy

that
anyone
would
have
difficulty
discerning

socio
political
bias
next
year
i
will
be
going
straight
so
i
will
tell
you
all
in
good
time
on
a
more
positive
note
all
of
the
downstairs
electronics
entertainment
center
will
be
unplugged
coded

so
maybe
just
maybe
downstairs
really
will
be
done

this
was
the
core
to
maverick
house
developing
as
a

irish
publishing
as
a
whole
is
terrified
of
the
word
international
and
the
furthest
their
heady
highs
will
take
them
is
far
flung
places
like
belfast
manchester
sheffield
liverpool
and
yes
the
far
and
distant
london
i
know
of
no
irish
publisher
outside
of
maverick
who
have
a
working
office
in
another
publishing
territory
outside
of
course
of
london
and
no
some
bloke
with
a
mobile
phone
living
in
a
wooden
shack
in
calcutta
does
not
equate
to
an
eastern
office
and
please
exclude
the
endeavours
of
publishers
like
hachette
penguin
and
transworld
random
house
who
have
entered
the
irish
landscape
to
inject
some
form
of
international
presence
in
the
irish
publishing
industry
but
those
authors
almost
inevitably
switch
to
the
uk
imprints

now

i
feel
a
little
bit
nostalgic
about
joel
s
one
and
only
christmas
a
christmas
i
can
never
return
to
i
enjoyed
that
christmas
but
i
realize
now
that
i
didn
t
enjoy
it
enough
one
of
the
things
i
learned
from
joel
s
death
is
that
life
is
so
fragile
that
we
ought
to
approach
every
day
with
the
knowledge
that
its
blessings
may
only
be
temporary
and
they
must
be
enjoyed
as
fully
as
possible

alright
this
spelling
occurs
also
in
the
hogarth
press
edition
as
i
stopped
and
collected
myself
i
felt
close
to
tears
this
was
my
idea
the
mountain
climb
the
practice
walk
the
whole
shooting
match
and
here
i
am
puffed
out
and
wanting
to
turn
back
i
really
felt
as
if
i
couldn
t
do
it
and
maybe
i
should
turn
back
instead
of
re
setting
the
pace
taking
my
time
i
just
felt
like
i
d
let
down
the
group
and
i
wasn
t
living
up
to
expectation
no
offense
old
pal
i
still
like
you
but
you
really
have
not
proven
yourself
to
be
worth
the
money
i
paid
for
you
i
still
remember
the
joy
i
felt
when
i
first
saw
you
in
italy
i
had
gone
on
vacation
to
the
boot
shaped
peninsula
with
a
friend
and
had
made
it
a
personal
goal
to
buy
an
authentic
italian
espresso
maker
during
my
once
in
a
lifetime
stay
this
goal
was
inspired
by
my
memories
of
my
family
once
owning
an
italian
espresso
maker
that
lasted
for
nearly
10
years
i
was
fed
up
with
using
the
low
quality
made
in
china
varieties
and
just
wanted
something
that
would
last
a
little
longer
i
figured
that
because
i
was
in
italy
i
would
be
provided
with
an
endless
stream
of
espresso
makers
i
am
not
as
familiar
with
gottfried
but
i
know
auster
follows
european
politics
almost
as
closely
as
he
follows
domestic
american
politics
his
main
concern
is
not
religion
it
is
anti
semitism
if
he
gets
the
slightest
whiff
that
a
person
or
organization
opposes
jewish
interests
explicitly
or
not
it
does
not
matter
whether
they
are
good
christians
dislike
muslims
or
agree
with
him
on
every
other
point
of
his
pro
jewish
worldview
there
might
well
be
problems
with
the
liberal
ideas
that
jews
have
supported
until
now
but
it
is
simply
wrong
to
pretend
that
jewish
liberals
act
from
liberal
motives
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
their
jewish
fears
and
hostilities
i
have
never
met
a
jewish
liberal
whose
leftist
politics
was
not
in
some
way
connected
to
his
self
identity
as
a
jew
auster
only
poses
as
an
anti
liberal
conservative
his
preoccupation
is
with
defending
jewish
interests
his
opposition
to
immigration
into
the
west
is
based
primarily
on
it
being
bad
for
jews
his
dissembling
about
liberalism
and
judeo
christian
heritage
is
only
part
of
his
deliberate
and
more
general
conflation
of
white
and
jewish
interests
gottfried
likewise
but
less
blatantly
poses
as
a
conservative
against
liberalism
together
he
and
his
friend
auster
demonstrate
that
self
identity
as
a
jew
is
not
only
connected
to
liberals
and
leftist
politics
you

t
talk
yourself
out
of

cramped

you

you
can
admit

embrace

and
settle
in

too
shall
pass
and
maybe
there
will
be
a
funky
happy

it

dictator

it
is
worth
noting
that
a
product
development
project
has
been
announced
which
could
change
the
game
with
regard
to
touchscreen
training
for
blind
users
the
national
braille
press
nbp
center
for
braille
innovation
and
the
national
federation
of
the
blind
nfb
are
cooperating
in
the
development
of
a
notetaker
or
personal
data
assistant
with
a
braille
display
which
will
run
on
the
android
operating
system
the
new
product
was
initially
called
the
the
braille
wizard
unhappily
wizard
as
a
name
was
already
copyrighted
so
nbp
is
conducting
a
contest
in
search
of
a
new
name
although
the
device
isn
t
likely
to
be
ready
for
delivery
before
2012
the
new
android
based
product
may
very
well
be
the
next
new
notetaker
in
our
field
as
other
developers
look
to
see
what
its
affects
will
be
on
the
market
and
how
close
it
will
come
to
its
unofficial
price
estimate
of
2
000
if
this
new
product
becomes
the
next
big
thing
whenever
it
might
be
released
touchscreen
training
for
blind
users
will
quickly
become
as
common
as
books
on
windows
and
microsoft
word
are
today
for
now
however
early
adopters
of
apple
and
android
products
may
be
the
best
available
source
of
information
on
those
touchscreens
which
have
begun
to
learn
to
talk

is
this
not
somewhat
disturbing
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
and
i
am
not
going
to
perform
a
google
search
on
this

not
be

them

was
off
slurping
and
that
gently
massaging
and
pulling
on
the
through
the
hole
she
started
to
shake
again
and
i
knew
she
was
on
my
again
i
grabbed
her
by
the
hair
and
pulled
her
back
up
to
my
mouth
as
i
began
to
kiss
her
i
pushed
her
against
the
wall
i
felt
behind
her
and
grabbed
his
and
guided
it
into
her
well
used
she
began
to
moan
deeply
now
started
kissing
me
tight
i
knew
he
was
all
the
way
into
her
and
began
to
pound
her
nicely
once
again
i
guided
her
mouth
back
onto
my
hard
it
didn
t
take
our
friend
long
before
he
grunted
deeply
and
blew
his
load
certainly
not
done
being
pummeled
i
grabbed
her
and
spun
her
around
sliding
into
her
freshly
i
reached
down
and
began
to
finger
her
she
moaned
with
delight
i
bent
her
over
and
without
hesitation
slid
my
hard
into
that
she
became
more
vocal
the
harder
i
her
and
it
was
making
me
even
more
crazy
it
didn
t
take
long
for
the
booth
next
to
us
to
become
occupied
again
this
time
the
friend
didn
t
waste
anytime
just
presenting
his
hard
to
iris
as
i
her
she
reached
down
and
began
to
the
he
almost
instantly
began
to
shake
and
forced
himself
hard
against
the
wall
with
a
muffled
moan
shot
out
all
over
iris
with
this
she
once
again
tensed
up
and
began
to
i
could
not
hold
out
any
longer
myself
and
blew
a
hard
load
into
her
we
both
quickly
gathered
ourselves
together
and
made
a
quick
get
away
into
the
parking
lot
and
the
safety
of
the
car
we
giggled
the
whole
way
home
now
that
was
an
end
to
the
year

you
have
to
admit
they
are
so
much
more
fun
then

a
preparation
for
death
is
a
memoir
of
a
few
years
in
greg
baxter
s
life
let
s
say
the
mid
2000s
though
it
s
hard
to
follow
the
chronology
precisely
and
anyway
he
swoops
back
into
previous
generations
now
and
then
it
s
an
account
of
the
years
that
led
to
and
from
the
breakdown
of
his
marriage
and
the
breakdown
of
his
ambition
to
be
a
novelist
when
no
thought
i
had
was
quiet
everything
was
a
military
march
meaning
a
day
off
from
work
filled
with
beer
first
hit
o'brien's
for
a
grilled
cheese
and
garlic
fries
paired
with
a
nice
fresh
alpine
o'brien's
ipa
great
ipa
as
always
the
malt
bill
in
that
is
fantastic
i
rarely
will
even
want
to
say
that
about
an
ipa
but
the
complexity
works
here
have
made
out
a

right
away

said
after
making
one
last
check
for
clothes
in
the
bedrooms
she
made
her
way
down
to
the
basement
the
sparse
room
seemed
dingy
and
damp
in
stark
contrast
to
the
fresh
spring
day
she
had
seen
from
her
upstairs
window
she
d
much
rather
be
outside
but
the
laundry
must
be
done
now
you
can
decide
where
to
go
when
these
are
valid
questions
but
they
kind
of
make
me
smile
because
the
last
time
i
checked
we
do
live
in
the
real
world
we
do
use

we
re

careful
about
the

see
knowing
they
can
never

but
my

and
i
don

subscribe
to

of

we
re
not

our

from

sheltering

from
the

of

we

fully
in

it
was
never
possible
to
completely
prevent
such
knowledge
from
being
discovered
and
disseminated
it
was
only
a
question
of
whether
the
knowledge
would
become
public
or
would
instead
be
classified
by
government

divisions
we
left
the
party
and
went
to
a
bowling
alley
bar
right
by
our
house
to
have
a
few
beers
and
to
mingle
with
the
locals
it
was
fun
to
talk
to
people
from
the
neighborhood
and
they
made
us
promise
we
would
come
back
i
m
sure
we
will
they
even
said
we
could
bring
jay
and
elle

to
stop
by
if
we
were
out
for
a
walk
it
was
a
fun
casual
atmosphere
with
good
people
there
are
many
directions
in
which
i
could
take
this
concept
but
the
one
in
which
i
have
the
greatest
interest
is
the
slow
of
a

for

the
more
we
can
begin
to
appreciate
and
account
for
a
the
fact
that
a
person
s
bad
top

rockford

behavior
in
one
moment
does
not
necessarily
warrant
writing
them
off
as
a
numbskull
and
b
the
actual
situational
factors
at
play
that
might
be
influencing
decisions
and
behaviors
the
more
effective
we
can
be
at
shaping
those
factors
and
to
be
frank
getting
what
we
want
a
point
of
criticism
for
the
media
in
general
these
articles
rarely
say
what
it
would
mean
to
close
the
parks
i
have
a
lot
of
respect
for
journalists
who
knock
on
politicians
 
doors
and
ask
hard
questions
and
even
saying
that
they
asked
but
did
not
get
an
answer
would
be
an
improvement
for
most
of
these
articles
there
is
no
discussion
of
what
closed
means
in
this
one
either
i
feel
very
lucky
for
having
known
such
wonderful
spiritual
guides
and
for
having
met

i
will

more
than
glad

loving

classic

a
lot
of
writers
find
themselves
trying
to
decide
between
self
publishing
and
the
traditional
publishing
route
frankly
it
s
a
great
time
for
writers
because
we
do
have
options
that
weren
t
available
a
few
years
ago
there
is
no
right
or
wrong
decision
it
really
is
about
what
is
right
for
that
author
and
where
they
are
in
their
career
the
self
publishing
route
offers
the
benefit
of
making
your
book
available
to
readers
without
facing
possible
rejection
and
revisions
and
that
can
be
a
wonderful
thing
as
long
as
your
book
is
ready
to
be
published
that
said
most
traditionally
published
authors
will
tell
you
that
they
are
glad
their
first
books
didn
t
get
published
because
they
learned
so
much
during
the
journey
even
though
at
the
time
they
were
certain
the
books
were
fabulous
a
lot
of
authors
who
have
written
a
book
that
just
didn
t
fit
into
a
genre
niche
are
finding
success
in
self
publishing
because
readers
aren
t
nearly
as
picky
about
genre
specifics
as
publishers
have
to
be
a
writer
serious
about
her
career
and
considering
self
publishing
should
attempt
to
make
sure
the
end
product
is
as
close
to
perfect
as
possible
this
may
or
may
not
require
the
hiring
of
others
to
help
you
through
the
process
so
the
overhead
of
getting
a
book
ready
to
self
publish
including
editing
line
editing
formatting
and
cover
design
may
vary
many
self
published
authors
are
finding
having
the
book
available
doesn
t
ensure
readers
will
buy
it
self
publishing
means
self
marketing
and
that
can
take
a
lot
of
writing
time
away
from
an
author
that
said
today
even
traditionally
published
authors
have
to
spend
a
lot
of
time
marketing
themselves
as
well
some
authors
simply
are
better
at
promoting
their
work
than
others
and
while
there
have
been
numerous
success
stories
of
authors
who
have
built
themselves
a
very
lucrative
career
through
self
publishing
others
who
followed
this
path
are
not
finding
the
financial
gains
as
they
had
hoped
it
bears
mentioning
however
that
many
new
authors
who
have
gone
the
traditional
path
of
publishing
are
equally
unhappy
about
their
financial
gain
also
many
of
the
traditionally
published
authors
may
find
their
contracts
dropped
if
sales
are
really
down
something
a
self
published
author
doesn
t
have
to
worry
about
in
most
instances
writers
who
have
already
made
a
name
for
themselves
and
have
a
fan
base
are
finding
the
self
publishing
route
an
easier
path
than
do
new
writers
however
the
truth
is
that
anything
and
everything
is
possible
if
a
friend
came
to
me
with
a
first
book
and
this
friend
simply
was
not
a
marketing
i
might
suggest
they
attempt
the
traditional
route
first
but
if
that
route
did
not
pan
out
and
she
felt
her
book
was
ready
then
i
would
encourage
them
to
take
it
the
self
publishing
route
that
said
if
this
person
has
a
viable
marketing
plan
to
ensure
that
her
book
goes
out
big
i
d
say
her
chances
of
earning
more
financial
gain
might
be
with
the
self
publishing
route
than
the
traditional
route
because
of
the
smaller
royalty
rate
earned
through
traditional
publishing
having
a
publisher
behind
you
does
not
mean
your
book
will
be
any
more
successful
but
a
publisher
s
name
still
carries
some
weight
to
some
readers
and
traditional
bookstores
building
a
name
with
a
publisher
behind
you
is
a
little
easier
than
building
it
on
your
own
another
thing
to
take
into
consideration
is
unless
you
are
one
of
the
talented
writers
who
have
the
ability
to
do
everything
from
designing
a
cover
to
a
final
editing
there
is
overhead
in
self
publishing
so
as
you
can
see
both
routes
can
bring
success
and
both
come
with
some
positives
and
negatives
to
consider
joe
yes
where
did
you
get
my
name
and
number
i
though
i
would
oppose
any
attempt
to
have
our
church
building
used
for
such
purposes
support
the
freedom
for
others
on
classically
liberal
grounds
more
on
that
later
however
it
raises
an
interesting
question
about
the
functioning
of
the
equalities
act
on
which
i
was
ruminating
the
other
day
it
has
a
partial
reference
also
to
the
bed
and
breakfast
question
which
was
debated
prior
to
the
election
last
year
and
explains
something
of
how
freedom
of
expression
functions
in
a
liberal
society
it
is
the
following
i
achieved
the
hot
air
balloon
on
the
paper
by
reloading
the
patterned
paper
into
the
printer
and
then
printing
the
digi
on
top
i
really
love
this
method
because
it
means
less
colouring
and
it
fits
your
project
perfectly
and
i
could've
gone
with
but
i
did
not
so
there
is
that
having
just
finished
one
month
as
visiting
faculty
at
the
school
of
management
at
the
indian
institute
of
technology
bombay
i
appreciate
more
than
ever
the
elusiveness
of
talking
about
a
setting
as
complex
as
india
with
over
a
billion
residents
various
ethnic
and
religious
groups
and
over
20
distinct
languages
there
is
seldom
if
ever
such
a
thing
as
india
when
it
comes
to
talking
about
india
context
nuance
and
focus
are
central
generalizations
are
often
misguided
at
best
misleading
at
worst

was

of
this

constantly

paul
was

so
in

we
walked

stood

for

women

and
do
not

though
adventuring

are
likely
to
opt
for
male

as
a

back
on
the
chain
gang
uk
there
has
been
years
of
ongoing
dispute
as
to
whether
the
teachers
and
school
system
are
primarily
responsible
for
the
care
of
a
child
or
whether
that
sole
responsibility
lies
in
the
hands
of
the
child
s
parents
i
have
always
believed
that
it
takes
a
village
to
raise
a
child
so
in
this
bill
you
will
see
that
the
responsibility
will
lie
at
the
breastplate
of
all
parties
involved
one
may
construe
the
document
as
follows
during
the
crisis
over
czechoslovakia
our
french
or
english
comrades
should
have
demanded
the
military
intervention
of
their
own
bourgeoisie
and
thereby
assumed
responsibility
for
the
war
not
for
war
in
general
and
of
course
not
for
a
revolutionary
war
but
for
the
given
imperialist
war
short
attention
span
unless
it
is
about
an
obsession
for
the
last
seven
years
we
have
used
what
i
call
a
push
model
and
it
has
proven
ineffective
because
it
is
the
embodiment
of
20th
century
learning
20th
century
learning
is
all
about
pushing
information
at
a
group
of
passive
recipients
the
recipients
are
expected
to
follow
detailed
instructions
take
notes
absorb
information
and
regurgitate
it
in
the
form
of
a
new
product
i
keep
a
set
of
notebooks
that
i
take
to
workshops
and
training
sessions
this
means
i
always
know
where
to
go
when
i
need
to
look
something
up
i
usually
secure
any
handouts
into
the
notebook
with
a
paperclip
and
keep
the
pages
together
with
an
elastic
band
these
notebooks
have
a
perforated
line
so
that
it
s
easy
to
tear
out
pages
and
file
them
elsewhere
as
necessary
i
went
shopping
today
finally
getting
around
to
going
shopping
with
my
birthday
money
so
while
i
m
all
excited
about
my
new
clothes
all
i
can
think
about
is
showing
them
off
for
chase
i
hope
he
likes
the
stuff
i
got
i
like
it
but
as
i
sit
here
in
my
new
top
and
shrug
i
think
it
would
be
a
perfect
going
out
outfit
i
m
planning
what
jewelry
and
make
up
i
ll
wear
and
deciding
for
what
event
i
ll
wear
it
when
chase
is
home
i
m
currently
leaning
to
a
night
out
maybe
dinner
with
friends
what
i
m
really
thinking
though
is
how
chase
will
look
at
me
throughout
that
night
that
look
that
says
wow
she
s
gorgeous
i
like
that
look
i
miss
that
look

things
today
athens
was
a
city
that
i
was
really
looking
forward
to
going
to
after
going
to
rome
and
seeing
all
of
these
ancient
ruins
mixed
in
with
amazing
architecture
fountains
on
every
corner
i
had
really
high
expectations
for
athens
i
was
at
first
really
disappointed
as
we
drove
through
crazy
busy
streets
with
really
modern
simple
architecture
and
graffiti
everywhere
my
first
impression
was
ah
typical
big
city
tristan
set
down
his
pack
and
rested
his
precious
lute
on
the
bench
the
gatekeeper
hauled
near
he
looked
around
himself
as
he
removed
his
sodden
cloak
and
spread
it
over
the
bench
to
dry
the
hall
was
a
strange
mixture
of
opulence
and
squalor
rich
tapestries
hung
from
the
walls
but
they
were
dark
with
years
of
soot
from
the
smoking
hearth
elaborately
carved
wooden
pillars
thick
as
the
trunks
of
ancient
trees
held
up
the
high
smoke
blackened
heavy
beamed
roof
far
above
him
where
most
halls
were
draped
and
decked
with
yuletide
greenery
this
time
of
year
mistletoe
ivy
and
holly
this
hall
lacked
any
sign
of
the
coming
celebration
of
christ
s
birth
torches
blazed
along
the
soot
stained
walls

you
can

or
any
other
social

site
to
enter
our
first
destination
although
we
didn
t
stop
was
a
place
called
macapa
which
is
on
the
northern
side
of
the
amazon
where
we
picked
up
our
pilot
to
show
us
the
way
down
the
river
to
santarem
didn
t
see
the
pilot
but
this
river
is
so
convoluted
with
masses
of
islands
and
tributaries
you
would
get
hopelessly
lost
not
to
say
run
aground
they
put
up
a
special
map
of
the
river
where
our
charts
are
and
there
are
several
rivers
at
the
mouth
which
go
on
for
miles
and
miles
because
of
these
islands
we
passed
very
close
to
the
shoreline
which
was
littered
with
driftwood
the
trees
rose
straight
from
the
water
s
edge
and
there
were
big
reeds
and
grasses
passing
us
in
the
river
were
big
clumps
of
green
various
vegetation
just
drifting
past
with
brown
logs
bobbing
up
and
down
thought
they
were
crocodiles
at
first
macapa
right
on
the
equator
looks
like
quite
a
large
town
houses
tall
buildings
and
some
masts
showing
little
huts
down
at
the
water
s
edge
but
didn
t
see
many
people
around
apart
from
a
few
who
were
fishing
in
narrow
boats
a
tug
boat
called
titan
was
pulling
two
huge
rafts
piled
high
with
sand
and
it
was
hot
and
humid
out
on
deck
here
comes
the
sun

sang
on
their

able

i
decided
to
find
a
recipe
since
i
cook
this
using
the
little
of
this
and
little
of
that
method
i
would
have
told
you
to
boil
the
noodles
fry
the
onions
and
cabbage
throw
in
some
sugar
and
pepper
and
enjoy
i
am
not
sure
that
would
have
given
much
guidance
in
looking
i
kept
coming
up
with
recipes
that
had
sour
cream
they
looked
delicious
and
i
would
like
to
try
this
one
day
but
that
was
not
my
memory

the
image
here
is
one
of

s
flowers
of
1971
gallerie
sho
from
tokyo
had
on
view
three
of
these
little
beauties
as
well
as
two
small
marilyns
1978
look
at
the
dimensions
the
flowers
are
less
than
2
inches
square
each
painting
is
carefully
screen
printed
stretched
on
canvas
and
framed
with
wee
nails
and
slates
of
wood
these
miniscule
works
are
reduced
to
sheer
perfection
oddly
seeing
theses
tiny
warhols
touched
me
much
more
than
seeing
originals
of
course
without
the
original
full
size
pieces
pettibone
s
couldn
t
exist
and
yet
seeing
these
lilliputian
paintings
is
breathtaking
they
become
objects

what

discerning
the
meaning
of
today
i
was
thinking
about
how
life
never
really
seems
to
go
according
to
our
plan
mostly
this
is
ok
somedays
it
is
a

bit
overwhelming

for

and
here's
a
close
up
shot
of
our
little
sitting
area
we
love
our
white
slipcovered
couch
from
ikea
although
it
is
in
desperate
need
of
a
good
washing
hence
the
throws
draped
over
the
cushions
it
looks
cozy
and
covers
up
a
mulititude
of
sins
i
also
used
some
of

as

they
always
find
a
way
into
my
stories
in
some
form
because
you
demanded
it
actually
only
one
person
was
kind
of
wondering
about
it
here's
some
fresh
haunted
house
action
finally
getting
around
to
the
house
itself
with
the
addition
of
windows
and
front
entrance
and
yes
that
is
the
twisted
gnarled
tree
from
the
2009
graveyard
scene
i
will
distort
it
a
little
more
to
fit
in
here
but
it
is
nice
to
have
some
ready
made
props
that
i
can
just
drop
in
click
on

size
now
i
want
to
add
a
little
bit
of
color
to
my
mermaid
she
never
seemed
to
do
it
she
does
not
wander
off
into
imaginary
play
and
get
lost
there
for
hours
her
dolls
have
collected
dust
polly
pocket
and
little
pet
shop
stuff
got
unwrapped
put
in
a
drawer
and
that
was
it
the
legend
of
bigfoot
is
crushingly
dull
unless
you
are
really
really
into
bigfoot
and
nature
films
and
even
if
you
are
really
really
into
nature
films
you
are
going
to
find
yourself
wishing
that
marx
would
get
to
some
point
or
that
bigfoot
would
rear
up
and
eat
him
at
the
very
least
i
suspect
you
are
going
to
find
yourself
reaching
for
the
remote
so
you
can
scan
past
the
boring
bits
what
do
wild
pigs
have
to
do
with
bigfoot
what
do
caribou
hunters
have
to
do
with
bigfoot
what
do
ground
squirrels
in
love
have
to
do
with
bigfoot
while
the
ground
squirrels
are
cute
they
have
nothing
do
to
with
bigfoot
yet
we
are
treated
to
scenes
of
all
the
above
that
seem
as
long
as
the
ten
years
marx
supposedly
hunted
bigfoot
oh
and
what
self
respecting
tracker
drives
a
red
vw
bug
even
if
it
was
the
seventies
and
drives
it
into
the
remote
central
washington
back
country
in
the
middle
of
winter
i
use
the
singular
form
on
purpose
even
if
the
popular
unrest
that
has
coursed
through
the
globe
in
the
last
year
has
manifested
itself
plurally
north
africa
has
just
seen
an
overhaul
and
overthrow
of
old
regimes
syria
is
the
next
stop
surely
the
occupy
movement
which
began
life
in
spain
with
los
indignados
the
outraged
mushroomed
instantly
and
took
hold
of
other
cities
such
as
toronto
new
york
and
london
online
groups
like
anonymous
are
bent
on
embarrassing
national
governments
with
their
pranks
everywhere
you
look
there
is
something
happening
or
about
to
happen
however
there
is
a
single
narrative
running
through
these
subversive
acts
that
seem
to
have
sprung
up
almost
simultaneously
a
fairer
society
where
there
is
more
respect
and
consideration
towads
our
fellow
humans
the
question
is
why
now
apparently
after
magatha
got
her
booted
out
of
thunder
bluff
she
went
into
hiding
in
thousand
needles
and
when
the
twilight
s
hammer
started
stepping
up
their
activity
there
they
captured
her
along
with
a
batch
of
others
nice
how
they
were
able
to
track
her
down
right
off
like
that
huh
yet
another
bang
up
job
by
my
team
so
when
lakota
sent
johnny
awesome
around
to
help
clean
up
the
grimtotem
mess
down
there
magatha
started
sending
messages
to
the
elf
to
get
him
to
release
her
pet
wind
serpent
arikara
along
the
way
johnny
awesome
also
killed
arnak
grimtotem
and
isha
gloomaxe
so
okay
good
news
there
since
that
takes
out
the
braintrust
that
had
been
coordinating
all
the
ogre
business
in
feralas
and
dustwallow
but
whatever
because
along
the
way
johnny
awesome
also
managed
to
round
up
a
batch
of
ancient
tauren
relics
the
writ
of
history
the
rattle
of
bones
and
the
drums
of
war
and
ended
up
handing
them
over
to
magatha
prayer
father
i
pray
for
the
lost
lives
of
the
millions
of
babies
that
die
from
abortions
in
this
country
and
throughout
the
world
it
is
the
height
of
wickedness
forgive
us
your
people
who
have
sat
idly
by
while
this
ongoing
massacre
continues
father
in
yahshua
jesus
name
i
pray
that
the
hearts
of
all
believer
s
will
be
pricked
and
they
will
repent
of
the
apathy
they
ve
had
towards
the
murderous
sacrifices
to
the
false
molech
called
abortion
i
pray
for
godly
repentance
to
come
upon
mothers
fathers
doctors
and
all
who
support
abortion
and
i
pray
that
they
will
fall
down
before
your
throne
confessing
and
asking
forgiveness
lord
jesus
fill
us
with
your
spirit
so
that
we
can
stand
against
the
powers
of
darkness
that
have
overtaken
the
minds
of
people
making
them
comfortable
with
the
sin
and
wickedness
that
envelope
this
world
i
ask
these
and
all
things
in
the
precious
holy
name
of
yahshua
hamashiach
jesus
christ
amen
but
before
we
get
into
the
detail
let
s
just
pause
and
examine
the
phrase
real
opposition
to
be
frank
i
ve
been
frustrated
and
annoyed
by
the
speed
with
which
even
where
lowlife
like
murdoch
are
concerned
people
still
scuttle
back
into
their
left
right
caves
at
the
first
sign
of
being
attacked
and
i
love
living
in
a
small
town
because
while
at
the
hospital
the
5
year
old's
kindergarten
teacher
called
to
see
if
we
would
still
be
in
the
hospital
when
she
passed
by
on
her
way
home
because
she
wanted
to
come
visit
unfortunately
we
were
about
to
be
discharged
while
we
waited
another
friend
called
to
let
me
know
he
had
heard
what
had
happened
and
to
see
if
there
was
anything
he
could
do
these
little
gestures
completely
warmed
my
heart
and
made
me
want
to
be
a
better
person
and
upon
arriving
home
the
5
year
old
boy
was
presented
by
his
6th
grade
brother
a
poster
his
class
had
put
together
at
school
in
the
center
of
the
poster
in
block
letters
were
the
words
get
well
soon
and
surrounding
that
were
sweet
notes
from
each
student
in
the
class
intermittently
taped
between
the
messages
were
pieces
of
wrapped
hard
candy
and
chocolate
it
was
adorable
evolutionarymystic
how
many
of
us
have
had
khaman
or
dhoklas
from
the
local
marwadi
snack
shop
or
a
high
end
snack
bar
almost
all
of
us
it
is
light
yummy
and
fills
the
stomach
is
nt
it
well
this
delightful
snack
has
its
origins
in
gujarat
and
it
is
called
khaman
it
is
also
called
as
dhoklas
in
many
other
places
in
the
shops
they
are
made
of
besan
or
gram
flour
here
i
have
made
them
in
the
traditional
gujarati
home
style
i
e
made
of
channa
dal
a
suspect
was
identified
and
a
foot
pursuit
commenced
the
suspect
was
apprehended
around
10
am
on
sunday
morning
and
is
currently
in
custody
the
investigation
is
ongoing
and
further

i
had
a
good
day
yesterday
i
went
to
my
friend
maren's
house
after
i
got
joe
on
the
bus
and
we
hung
out
her
hubby
had
the
laptop
and
she
wanted
to
check
her
mail
and
send
out
a
few
emails
i
was
only
too
happy
to
oblige
feels
good
to
know
about
the
real
pulpy
deal
right
c
mon
show
me
a
smile
on
the
comment
box
and
you
might
win
yourself
a
really
pulpy

that
s
a
chance
to
win
a

simply
by

sweet
c'mon
you
just
might
be
picked
as

lucky

why
is
wilderness
travel
so
dull
in
game
tomorrow
i
finish
laundry
fling
around
some
kettlebells
and
take
back
my
life
jack
oakie
s
role
here
is
very
similar
to
his
turn
as
sidekick
to
spencer
tracy
in
wellman
s
looking
for
trouble
the
previous
year
once
again
he
has
a
lot
of
comic
moments
but
always
with
a
strong
buddy
relationship
underlying
the
humour
and
you
feel
that
he
is
always
looking
out
for
his
more
volatile
friend
and
checking
he
is
all
right
according
to
the
same
review
at
the
imdb
that
i
ve
already
referred
to
the
original
intention
was
for
oakie
s
character
to
be
shot
dead
by
the
villainous
smith
but
it
was
felt
audiences
wouldn
t
put
up
with
the
comic
actor
being
killed
and
so
this
scene
was
cut
before
release
however
this
deleted
scene
apparently
survives
it
would
be
fascinating
to
see
it
still
in
good
condition
all
without
limit
without
circumference
the
center
all
encompassing
katy
perry
in
my
opinion
will
look
in
a
burlap
bag
add
a
pair
of
pigalles
heels
and
she
looks
absolutely
stunningly
what
a
nice
breath
of
fresh
air
she
is
she
can
do
nothing
wrong
in
my
eyes
slice
the
chunk
of
steak
across
grain
into
long
thin
strips
combine
the
fish
sauce
soy
sauce
oil
sriracha
brown
sugar
cilantro
garlic
and
remaining
seasonings
in
a
small
bowl
place
the
steaks
in
a
large
sealable
container
or
ziploc
bag
pour
in
the
marinade
seal
and
toss
to
evenly
distribute
let
marinate
in
the
refrigerator
overnight
when
ready
to
cook
weave
meat
onto
individual
skewers
and
lay
flat
in
shallow
container
heat
a
grill
pan
over
high
heat
place
the
skewers
on
the
grill
pan
and
cook
until
the
meat
is
cooked
through
about
7
minutes
flipping
them
over
halfway
through
grilling
transfer
to
a
platter
sprinkle
with
cilantro
and
serve
when
i
worked
as
a
screenwriter
for
children's
television
in
the
1990s
for
the
likes
of
hbo
paramount
hanna
barbera
alliance
atlantis
and
the
cbc
i
was
sometimes
called
upon
to
write
bibles
for
shows
one
of
the
chapters
was
usually
on
the
danger
factors
or
violence
levels
for
the
kids
at
home
or
to
put
it
plainly
could
they
repeat
this
at
home
and
die
or
or
wound
or
injure
themselves
in
the
process
most
of
the
shows
i
worked
on
wanted
to
avoid
at
all
costs
danger
levels
that
could
or
might
lead
to
a
child
being
hurt
in
any
way
and
indeed
psychologists
worked
with
writers
often
to
strike
a
proper
balance
this
sort
of
concern
might
surprise
some
industry
watchers
who
consider
everything
aimed
at
children
as
cynical
or
profit
led
when
in
fact
and
not
just
to
avoid
litigation
but
that
too
quality
is
often
uppermost
in
the
creators
 
minds
imagine
that
you
lived
in
a
place
where
water
borne
diseases
were
rampant
your
local
water
source
is
contaminated
and
typhoid
outbreaks
occur
whenever
major
flooding
occurs
probably
from
sewage
and
contaminants
entering
your
water
supply
thousands
of
people
become
ill
and
many
even
die
there
are
no
trained
water
staff
to
effectively
treat
the
water
to
protect
human
health
seems
worlds
away
doesn
t
it
guidestar's
suzanne
coffman
told
me
that
we
post
what
the
irs
gives
us
and
we
don
t
know
why
the
attachment
was
not
included
in
the
scan
the
irs
sent
us
the
longer
answer
is
that
the
irs
does
not
usually
redact
the
names
of
organizations
that
received
grants
or
contributions
from
a
form
990
filer
in
this
case
the
schedule
may
have
been
removed
erroneously
before
the
990
was
scanned
or
the
forest
city
ratner
companies
foundation
may
have
failed
to
include
it
when
they
sent
the
return
to
the
irs
unfortunately
we
have
no
way
of
determining
what
happened
i
think
we
may
have
very
nice
new
neighbors
he
said
let
him
be
rich
and
wearie
that
at
least
and
now
we
come
to
the
point
where
i
have
gone
on
for
far
too
long
before
i
let
you
go
though
let
me
point
you
to
a
few
excellent
resources
regarding
joe
and
his
debut
novel
so
now
i
skip
that
section
of
the
menu
and
indulge
in
the
pasta
instead
fred
was
smart
from
the
get
go
ordering
the
exact
same
pasta
dish
the
tajarin
handcut
tagliatelli
5
hour
pork
sugo
and
porcini
mushrooms
on
every
visit
he
clearly
knows
something
that
i
do
not
because
at
one
point
i
imagined
that
surely
the
paparadelle
with
braised
short
rib
ragu
and
roasted
chanterelles
must
be
even
better
it
was
not
of
course
and
so
i
sent
its
meaty
extremely
rich
goodness
it
was
good
i
just
could
not
eat
it
with
a
tajarin
sitting
in
forking
distance
back
to
the
kitchen
and
took
a
plate
of
what
fred
was
having
instead
i
do
not
know
what
it
is
about
that
dish
but
those
buttery
thin
wiggly
tender
handcut
noodles
with
the
perfect
amount
of
meat
sauce
on
top
deliver
us
both
100
satisfaction
there
are
two
sizes
10
and
15
the
15
is
too
much
for
me
and
the
10
is
too
little
for
fred
go
figure
go
order
i
called
his
office
and
listened
carefully
to
their
voicemail
options
as
it
seems
they
had
changed
recently
patience
paid
off
when
i
learned
that
option
6
was
to
cancel
a
sales
presentation
it
looked
like
my
rejection
could
be
done
automatically
in
the
greek
myth
of
pandora
hope
is
the
final
force
left
in
the
box
of
plagues
that
is
unleashed
upon
humankind
and
while
hope
is
often
the
only
thing
one
has
left
i
think
that
some
people
seem
to
ignore
the
fact
that
it
was
still
one
of
the
things
in
the
box
of
plagues
hope
is
not
a
bad
plague
with
which
to
be
plagued
certainly
i
m
sure
we
all
prefer
it
to
famine
and
dysentery
for
example
it
can
still
be
a
harsh
and
fickle
mistress
if
not
an
entirely
false
one
in
the
findhorn
community
when
the
various
angels
that
they
recognize
were
being
brainstormed
and
added
to
a
list
hope
was
one
that
was
eventually
rejected
because
of
the
possibility
that
hope
can
be
false
whereas
many
of
the
other
angels
they
recognized
play
strength
peace
etc
are
goods
in
themselves
and
things
that
tend
to
be
positive
of
course
some
may
criticize
the
new
age
emphasis
on
only
good
things
implied
in
this
schema
and
yet
there
is
a
lesson
to
be
learned
in
all
of
this
if
it
is
possible
for
hope
to
betray
someone
isn
t
that
a
violation
of
fides
and
yet
again
fortuna
and
tyche
are
goddesses
as
much
as
any
other
and
their
favor
is
not
always
guaranteed
either

arguments

empirical
tests
after
dessert
we
sealed
an
eye
chart
inside
a
ziploc
bag
and
put
it
at
the
bottom
of
a
large
tub
of
water
i
immersed
my
head
in
the
tub
and
opened
my
eyes
pen
poised
over
a
notepad
but
was
unable
to
discern
even
the
largest
of
the
letters
despite
still
having
my
glasses
on
i
got
a
worthless
degree
in
broadcast
journalism
while
most
of
the
classes
i
took
were
a
complete
waste
of
my
time
money
and
mind
there
were
a
couple
that
i
found
pretty
interesting
one
of
those
was
a
basic
video
production
class
is
it
because
in
a
lot
of
ad
agencies
radio
is
seen
as
a
way
of
letting
juniors
cut
their
teeth
before
getting
stuck
into
tv
in
one
big
agency
i
worked
for
there
was
definitely
an
unwritten
hierarchy
of
media
that
you
got
to
scale
as
you
proved
yourself
and
i
can
tell
you
radio
was
not
at
the
higher
end
also
norma
does
not
have
any
toes
on
her
right
foot
which
really
off
that
totally
pretend
foot
fetish
i
made
up
yesterday
she
is
not
alone
though
frank
langella
is
missing
half
of
his
face
the
inevitable
moral
wonderings
soon
give
way
to
cosmic
nonsense
of
the
highest
order
a
later
scene
sees
james
marsden
step
into
a
liquid
box
reminiscent
of
something
out
of
2001
a
space
odyssey
this
is
not
2001
a
space
odyssey
though
so
its
trying
just
seems
daft
admittedly
the
psychedelic
music
and
wallpaper
and
james
marsden's
sideburns
are
fun
maybe
a
joke

no
one
s
heard
her
answer
from
the
grave
well
no
one
has
ever
accused
the
reigning
communist
government
of
south
africa
the
anc
of
having
a
brain
cell
to
share
amongst
all
2000
mps
or
whatever
the
latest
number
of
parliament
members
the
country
is
at
now
in
their
infinite
wisdom
they
are
now
challenging
the
restriction
on
singing
the
song
so
let's
think
about
this
for
a
moment
besides
the
obvious
that
they
are
not
very
bright
just
why
would
they
want
to
appeal
the
banning
of
a
highly
racist
and
violence
inducing
song
in
a
country
where
over
18
000
people
are
murdered
every
year
that
is
the
figure
that
the
anc
admit
to
we
know
it
is
higher
and
more
like
30
000
murders
a
year
makes
you
think
could
it
be
that
they
want
to
keep
racial
tension
simmering
forever
so
that
their
dumbed
down
black
population
do
not
look
to
the
ancs
obvious
governmental
failings
could
it
be
that
this
is
the
next
step
to
ensure
whites
are
forced
off
their
land
out
of
sheer
terror
of
what
is
to
come
whatever
the
reason
this
is
what
south
africa
and
the
great
anc
has
been
reduced
to
keeping
the
masses
of
people
living
in
poverty
relying
on
the
government
for
their
hand
outs
whilst
all
the
while
the
anc
live
like
kings

of

payer

but
are
too
often
unaware

they
wield

the

i
was
in

and
i
spotted
a
key
ring
with
a
frog
on
it
for

so
i
bought
it
once
i
had
removed
the
hook
from
his
head
i
attached
him
to
the
ort's
lid
with
velcro
and
now
i
have
a

of

this
is
emphasized
in
the
very
speech
that
jules
gives
to
one
of
the
robbers
that
he
can
with
impunity
because
of
his
role
that
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
anything
he
is
he
mentions
that
his
bibilical
quote
is
almost
incidental
to
his
character
like
so
many
of
the
details
of
the
parts
in
this
movie
it
was
just
a
cold
blooded
thing
to
say
it
is
something
he
never
questioned
only
now
does
he
try
to
place
others
in

this
was
also
the
book
where
i
first
read
in
detail
about
napoleon
and
his
strategy
on
war
it
is
brilliantly
portrayed
in
the
book
the
book
is
a
sort
of
fictional
history
with
very
accurate
historical
events
but
at
the
same
time
the
story
is
centered
around
some
fictional
characters
the
events
leading
to
the
war
resilience
of
russian
people
the
way
they
fight
back
makes
this
book
a
true
epic
on
one
hand
there
is
historical
war
and
on
the
other
hand
there
are
simple
dreams
and
aspirations
of
young
people
and
how
these
two
mix
up
with
each
other
as
the
story
moves
forward
is
truly
exceptional
i
was
invited
into
the
tent
with
the
two
male
bikers
i
was
so
na
ve
at
the
time
i
crawled
inside
and
tommy
took
out
a
gallon
jug
of
homemade
elderberry
wine
and
offered
me
a
glass
of
it
i
suddenly
felt
very
grown
up
i
started
out
sipping
on
that
potion
and
ended
up
gulping
until
i
collapsed
on
the
dirt
floor
of
the
tent
someone
transported
me
back
to
my
mother
and
my
aunt
that
night
completely
and
stinking
of
wine
my
mother
was
furious
she
was
upset
that
someone
at
the
orphanage
might
get
wind
of
it
she
was
worried
that
she
or
her
friends
might
look
bad
and
that
she
could
get
into
some
kind
of
trouble
if
word
got
out
i
cannot
forget
that
she
was
never
concerned

me

seem

you
really
never

you

the

awesome

no

it
s
the
best

people

is
that
a
saying
if
it
is
it
s
kind
of
a
that
the
boss
spoke
to
me
on
the
monday
and
accused
me
of
being
asleep
while
 
your
customers
were
calling
you
 
he
trusted
these
fools
more
than
me
just
before
the
announcement
at
9
am
bush
sr
ordered
the
demolition
of

center
to
stop
the
international
banking
computers
on

and

in
the
north

from
initiating

s

explosives
in
the
world

were
planted
by
both
cia
and
mossad
operatives
and
detonated
remotely
in
building

which
was
demolished
later
that
day
in
order
to
cover
up
their
crime
but
if
people
cared
about
statistics
then
no
one
would
root
for
the

david

my
bride
i
am
so
blessed
given
the
growing
locavore
trend
it
is
becoming
increasingly
easier
to
find
restaurants
and
food
trucks
that
feature
local
ingredients
while
traveling
the
simplest
way
to
seek
out
these
gems
is
by
asking
the
locals
where
the
best
places
to
eat
are
and
which
restaurants
feature
local
ingredients
another
hint
to
finding
locavore
friendly
spots
is
to
follow
food
bloggers

the

are

where
he

the

outlawed

until
the

in

1941
at

point
the
germans
told
the

government
to
intern
the
leaders
of
the
danish
communists
which
they
did
in

about
250

so
trying
to
make

is
much
more
difficult
than
i
realized
buck
how
do
you
deal
with
the
guys
from
pennsyltucky
burn
their

or
tell
them
there
s
fresh
woodchuck
in
the

so
no
i
didn
t
get
the
first
chair
but
was
on
maybe
the
6th
and
it
didn
t
seem
like
anyone
ahead
was
going
to
be
so
fast
from
the
chair
it
all
looked
like
flat
corduroy
so
i
chose
hellgate

as
1st
choice

all
the

first

and
chose
cliff

s

sweeter
now
that
s
how
it
should
always
be

guess
what
the

was

made

two
days
ago
at

game
the
little
kids
were
lying
on
the
ground
coloring
with
markers
clay
got
bored
coloring
and
stacked
3
markers
together
in
a
kind
of
makeshift
light
saber
because
playing
with
weapons
is
always
a
good
idea
anyway
this
looked
like
fun
to
brooklyn
who
did
the
same
thing
except
she
decided
she
wanted
all
of
the
markers
so
she
ran
around
chasing
clayton
screaming
and
whining
that
she
wanted
his
markers
too
right
on
cue
clay
took
off
teasing
and
taunting
her
just
to
make
her
scream
a
little
louder
because
not
everyone
within
a
15
mile
radius
could
hear
her
yup

of

of

instead
of

that

the

in

students

second
we

been

with
wonderful
christmas
cards
this

and
i
feel
pretty
lame
for
not
sending
any
out
this
year
correction
i
sent
out
about
ten
to
old
people
whose
feelings
would
be
hurt
if
they
did
not
get
one
but
otherwise
dear
friends
i
love
you
all
dearly
but
if
you
want
a
card
you
are
out
of
luck
please
consider
this
my
christmas
offering
for
the
year
they
opted
to
visit
that
famed
tinsel
town
when
i
was
very
young
perhaps
6
i
taught
myself
how
not
to
cry
how
to
shut
down
any
emotion
or
sense
i
might
feel
and
go
numb
from
the
inside
out
it
worked
but
now
happens
involuntarily
and
i
feel
dead
during
this
time
last
month
i
grabbed
my
bubble
wand
my
desire
to
write
and
encourage
women
for
christ
and
started
blowing
bubbles
i
put
at
the
focus
of
my
blog
not
myself
i
sent
out
a
few
submissions
to
christian
organizations
to
be
published
i
started
writing
an
online
bible
study
ok
let
s
test
that
hypothesis
virginia
of
all
the
songs
i
discovered
while
completing
this
task
i
am
more
proud
of
this
one
than
any
other
east
virginia
blues
was
recorded
by
the
carter
family
i
m
not
talking
about
the
carter
family
with
mother
maybelle
and
her
children
which
included
june
carter
cash
i
am
talking
about
the
original
group
started
by
a
p
carter
there
is
a
great
story
there
that
predates
anything
that
happened
in
nashville
later
while
the
supper
dishes
dry
on
the
counter
i
recruit
a
volunteer
to
help
me
stir
up
a
big
of
hot
cocoa
for
the
next
hour
it
will
warm
on
the
back
burner
tantalizing
us
with
its
aroma
the
sfas
went
away
because
goodby
was
sweeping
the
show
every
year
it
finally
competing
agencies
off
so
badly
they
did
not
bother
entering
work
in
the
show
anymore
bracelets
hand
pieces
ring
bracelets
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
i
love
it
all
i
hate
falling
in
love
with
a
design
that
is
older
and
now
sold
out
like
this
low
luv
by
erin
wasson
metal
hand
piece
pictured
i
have
been
scouring
the
web
for
a
worthy
design
to
get
and
this
is
my
ideal
fit
but
alas
it
isnt
available
anymore
from
what
i
have
researched
the
designer
behind
the
brand
is
erin
wasson
a
model
you
probably
would
recognize
due
to
maybelline
ads
how
much
creativity
she
actually
puts
into
the
pieces
i
am
unsure
of
but
i
am
sure
that
i
love
almost
everything
in
the
line
there
are
a
lot
of
stories
video
and
podcasts
out
there
that
chronicle
the
worst
of
school
lunches
in
america
really
what
s
that
about
who
exactly
is
taking
the
issue
into
the
bedroom
my
long
pent
up
rebuttal
to
this
absurd
comment
is
as
follows
who
read
blog
after
blog
after
blog
trying
to
prepare
her
heart
for
what
she
was
about
to
see
this
sister
so
why
is
dialogue
from
star
trek
spliced
with
music
by
tangerine
dream
special
i
suppose
the
main
reason
is
that
i
never
thought
i
d
hear
it
again
without
going
into
too
much
detail
if
you
like
adventure
based
historicals
this
one
has
plenty
of
it
and
is
a
meaty
tome
it
took
me
a
few
days
of
reading
between
the
overtime
and
the
dreaded
real
world
but
i
was
pleased
by
how
well
the
book
worked
out
and
how
open
it
leaves
itself
to
the
sequels
of
pictures
and
of
shimmering
gowns
since
i
was
yakking
about
the
a
z
challenge
last
friday
it
is
only
fair
to
provide
a
sign
up
link
now
that
the
challenge
is
open
for
registration
you
can
register
at
any
of

right
now
this
show
is
a
one
time
deal
in
the
way
that
further
bookings
will
be
hinged
on
us
delivering
a
great
show
we
would
like
to
play
more
dates
in
the
future
but
we
do
need
to
take
it
one
show
at
a
time
i
have
total
confidence
that
we
will
bring
our
a
game
to
the
festival
russia
s
volga
river
is
the
longest
waterway
in
europe
it
winds
its
way
south
from
northwest
russia
to
the
caspian
sea
many
tributaries
pour
into
the
volga
causing
its
swiftly
flowing
blue
green
waters
to
rush
even
faster
through
the
centuries
the
river
has
been
a
major
transportation
route
even
today
barges
carry
goods
to
and
from
factories
along

shore
would
you
like
to
try
it
to
pay
attention
to
all
of
the
detailed
information
thrown
at
us
by
the

my

i
would

that
makes
me
feel
great
endurance
events
are
a
mental
battle
not
just
a
physical
one
and
if
there
s
anything
that
i
can
do
to
add
a
bit
more
positivity
to
the
day
then
i
m
going
to
do
it
so
i
ve
been
having
a
look
round
a
few
websites
checking
out
the
options
there
s
some
lovely
kit
out
there
and
far
more
choice
than
when
i
was
a
middle
distance
running
teenager
here
s
a
few
things
i
found
on
sweatshop
my
favourite
running
gear
website
there
will
be
blood
as
well
as
the
compatibility
with
the
new
ipad
and

of

there
are
a
few
other

has
been

you
can
now
draw

of
the
inner
or
outer
area
of
your

have
also
been
added
to
the

in
order
to
help
give
users
a
starting
point
as
well
as
save
valuable
time
contact
your
local
police
for
more
details
about
this
musee
d
orsay
this
museum
may
not
be
the
massive
size
of
louvre
but
its
impressionist
collection
is
among
the
best
in
the
world
the
museum
is
housed
in
a
former
rail
station
and
has
the
atmosphere
and
personality
to
match
the
musee
d
orsay
attracts
2
1
million
visitors
annually
it
was
amazing
they
were
going
to
give
her
what
we
would
have
called
in
the
olden
days
a
ticket
not
a
computerised
one
but
a
paper
one
and
just
because
the
amazing
kasmira
requested
it
here
is
a
video
i
helped
some
friends
make
i
actually
won
an
acting
award
for
this
in
the
words
of
my
sister
no
way
now
then

you

also
finished
a
prairie

ornament
this
was
my
first
time
to
finish
as
a
little
hornbook
my
husband
made
the
hornbook
for
me
it
was
a
struggle
i
kept
cutting
down
the
cardboard
to
make
it
smaller
but
i
think
i
should
have
gone
a
little
smaller

they
want

opportunity
has
to
be
there
thanks
for
the
note
i
thought
about
putting
a
couple
of
larger
plates
on
the
shelf
but
then
i
would
be
overlapping
them

i'd
like
to

la
i

so
we
were
over
at

last
year
and
we
were
on

bill
for

of

with
the

i
follow
aidan
moffat
on

he
s
a
very
funny
twitist
he
was
going
to
some
awards
show
recently
and
mentioned
that
the
only
thing
he
d
heard
of
on
the
bill
was
our
band
and
i
didn
t
even
know
he
was
aware
of
us
our
hostesses
this
month
were
lj
for
the
divas
and
terry
for
the
dazzlers
their
theme
for
this
month
was
masculine
and
i
have
to
say
i
just
loooove
the
sentiments
that
lj
sent
us
both
the
image
and
sentiments
are
from
a
muse
art
stamps
oh
and
the

from

was
absolutely
divine

i
am
entitled
to
a
place
at
the
heavenly
table
and
a
part
in
ushering
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
now
more
justice
more
mercy
more
peace
more
life
today
if
i
want
to
if
i
choose
it
i
am
entitled
to
the
truly
good
things
of
life
the
fruit
of
the
spirit
even
but
if
i
want
more
joy
love
peace
patience
etc
then
i
must
make
room
we
have
said
nothing
quite
simply
because
it
s
nothing
to
do
with
britain
and
therefore
nothing
to
do
with
the
british
national
party
that
is
the
simple
answer
to
the
number
of
newer
readers
who
have
emailed
recently
to
ask
why
this
website
has
said
nothing
about
the
current
number
one
international
news
topic
israel
s
targeted
but
massive
air
and
ground
response
to
indiscriminate
but
relatively
feeble
hamas
missile
strikes
on
israeli
civilians
getting
more
of
the
brain
to
work
to
produce
a
complex
movement
is
plausibly
beneficial
for
overall
brain
function
maybe
it
is
the
motor
equivalent
of
building
a
cognitive
reserve
by
learning
to
play
the
cello
at
55
years
old
or
doing
crossword
puzzles

the
italian
police
attributed
this
terrorist
act
to
the
red
brigades
but
ultimately
gladio
was
pronounced
guilty
a
month
and
a
half
later
during

in
munich
there
was
another
act
of
terror
colonel
klaus
fishner
a
former
employee
of
the
counter
intelligence
service
of
stasi
said
the
task
was
to
create
tension
in
nato
countries
and
to
suppress
any
political
left
wing
deviation
as
we
can
see
that
was
the
mission
aimed
at

most
people
struggle
with
where
to
start
thanks
for
stopping
by
i
would
like
to
enter
this
into
the
following
challenges
we
extend
our
hand
to
all
neighboring
states
and
their
peoples
in
an
offer
of
peace
and
good
neighborliness
and
appeal
to
them
to
establish
bonds
of
cooperation
and
mutual
help
with
the
sovereign
jewish
people
settled
in
its
own
land
the
state
of
israel
is
prepared
to
do
its
share
in
a
common
effort
for
the
advancement
of
the
entire
middle
east
my
house
sounds
and
looks
like
an
adirondack
tb
hospital
the
children
are
sitting
around
wrapped
in
blankets
coughing
like
emphysematic
smokers
while
their
dutiful
nurse
scurrys
from
patient
to
patient
dispensing
antipyretics
like
precious
shots
of
kentucky
bourbon
thankfully
none
of
them
are
exhibiting
severe
or
troubling
signs
beyond
elevated
temps
and
yucky
coughs
we
have
found
ourselves
quite
smitten
with
butterflies
lately
first
there
was
the
tent
caterpillar
we
found
at
the
park
we
brought
it
home
to
observe
it
and
placed
it
in
one
of
our
bug
studying
habitats
it
was
so
active
and
had
such
interesting
markings
i
was
looking
forward
to
trying
to
get
a
good
photo
of
it
but
surprise
we
woke
up
in
the
morning
to
find
it
had
formed
a
cocoon
and
about
two
weeks
later
we
woke
up
to
find
the
cocoon
empty
sadly
i
did
not
get
a
good
picture
of
the
moth
either
it
is
so
annoying
when
nature
will
not
comply
with
my
compulsive
need
to
document
everything
the
timing
couldn
t
be
better
bush
said
this
project
will
generate
significant
revenue
in
direct
and
indirect
spinoffs
many
business
sectors
stand
to
gain
from
hotels
and
restaurants
to
tourist
attractions
and
transport
there
are
other
benefits
it
will
result
in
extra
revenue
collected
from
duty
employment
for
local
contractors
and
other
opportunities
for
caymanians
and
an
increase
in
tourism
and
take
me
to
my
mrs
claws
and
in
the
midst
of
these
blessings
there
is

i
am
back
today
with
an
entry
to
the
monday
memories
prompt
this
weeks
idea
was
remember
a
gift
you
have
been
given
i
think
i
am
also
lucky
because
my
parents
have
not
been
traditional
malays
especially
my
mother
who
raised
me
there
was
of
course
some
talk
of
malay
superstition
don
t
sing
in
the
kitchen
or
you
ll
get
an
old
husband
sort
of
stuff
of
course
i
was
always
singing
in
the
kitchen
and
as
of
yet
have
never
had
a
relationship
with
anyone
older
than
me
maybe
they
meant
i
would
get
married
when
i
was
old
and
therefore
have
an
old
husband
mixed
with
that
there
were
western
superstitions
my
mother
would
actually
turn
around
if
a
black
cat
passed
in
front
of
her
this
went
on
until
i
got
my
cat
zorro
who
was
really
probably
the
devil
incarnate
but
after
he
walked
past
my
mother
a
few
times
a
day
and
no
evil
luck
befell
her
she
gave
up
that
particular
superstition
it
was
an
interesting
way
to
grow
up
at
the
very
least
rating
5
out
of

to

little
knees

seven
years
old
victoriya
was
on
her
own
this
would
be
the
theme
of
her
life
for
the
next
nine
years
her
mother
did
not
want
her
and
there
was
no
father
in
the
picture
even
though
she
wanted
her
mother
she
didn
t
like
the
string
of
boyfriends
that
had
come
and
gone
seducing

my
favorite
examples
of
grammatical
borrowings
are
two
strange
formations
found
only
in
welsh
and
english
the
auxiliary
do
verb
for
questions
and
negatives
where
do
you
live
i
don
t
know
and
the
progressive
present
tense
as
the
default
present
tense
i
am
eating
not
i
eat
like
in
almost
every
other
language
anyway
most
of
the
grammatical
features
syntax
semantics
etc
are
more
interesting
to
linguists
normal
people
are
generally
more
interested
by
words
vocabulary
latin
vocabularius
and
lexicon
greek
lexikon
both
have
the
same
etymological
meaning
of
words
which
first
came
from
the
verb
to
speak
in
both
examples
given
that
there
are
so
many
words
in
english
and
so
many
speakers
and
readers
perhaps
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
how
many
words
the
average
speaker
knows
surely
it
is
impossible
for
anyone
to
reach
even
a
quarter
of
the
supposed
million
word
threshold
especially
considering
that
a
great
percentage
of
those
are
technical
and
specialized
words
or
jargon
in
the
final
part
of
our
interview
with

this

i

a

taking
up
a
specific
area
of
a
pub
if
there
is
something
important
on
and
there
was
i
admit
but
the
screen
is
situated
in
the
middle
of
the
pub
as
soon
as
the
coverage
started
the
whole
pub
became
a
sea
of
gawping
and
gasping
and
groaning
the
pub
practically
became
the
fixture

my

up

this

is

yes
it
was
time
for
my
quarterly
visit
to
get
my
iron
levels
checked
the
joys
of
being
an
anaemic
runner
i
hate
going
mainly
because
i
feel
a
bit
of
a
fraud
sitting
among
the
genuinely
poorly
people
but
on
the
other
hand
it
gives
me
a
chance
to
do
one
of
my
favourite
things
people
watch
and
boy
is
there
a
variety
of
people
to
watch
in
pinderfields
fulton
was
way
ahead
of
his
time
on
this
one
and
the
the
concept
was
a
popular
subject
of
ridicule
both
in
social
circles
and
in
the
press
according
to
an
1898
eagle
article
recalling
the
weapon's
history
so
we
proclaim
wednesday
october
20
as
the
spina
bifida
kids
worldwide
day
of
prayer
we
believe
in
the
power
of
prayer
and
we
are
excited
at
the
prospect
of
many
people
praying
at
the
same
time
for
these
unborn
babies
we
moms
can
make
a
difference
individually
and
collectively
but
that
is
nothing
compared
to
the
change
that
can
come
if
we
have
on
our
side
he
answered
yes
lord
you
know
that
i
love
you
lay
me
gently
in
the
earth
i
do
not
want
to
listen
to
someone
mourning
the
last
episode
of
gossip
girl
or
how
their
life
is
ending
because
they
can
not
afford
a
chanel
bag
it
is
terrible
major
inspiration
pictures
from
the
selby
i
do
have
to
say
that
campaign
play
is
always
going
to
be
my
main
fun
and
focus
i
just
love
having
time
for
characters
and
situations
to
be
developed
through
ongoing
gameplay
for
these
more
or
less
one
shots
although
this
is
the
second
time
running
the
same
character
for
both
terry
and
another
guy
so
i
try
to
collect
the
character
sheets
at
the
end
to
keep
them
in
case
somebody
plays
again
in
the
future
i
just
think
in
terms
of
several
encounter
situations
and
loosely
tie
them
together
there
isn
t
a
ton
of
time
for
sandboxing
a
not
funny
because

conversation
august

1976
bombay
i
got
an
email
on
tuesday
from
his
grandson
that
he
passed
away
monday
night
just
when
you
think
you
have
met
the
most
beautiful
woman
another
one
shows
up
and
overturns
the
tables
be
sad
and
disappointed
in
oneself
but
also
remember
that
most
of
my
freshmen
haven
t
dropped
out
and
that
my
seniors
are
more
ready
for
college
than
they
were
a
year
ago
people
are
always
shocked
that
he
is
14
months
they
say
oh
but
he
is
so
tall
well
he
looks
tall
because
he
is
ridiculously
skinny
people
say
oh
he
looks
so
grown
up
because
he
has
no
baby
fat
let
me
explain
i
go
by
my
middle
name
for
the
past
3
yrs
now
something
that
kinda
happened
once
i
moved
to
sacramento
it
was
supposed
to
be
my
first
name
but
my
grandma
said
it
was
too
close
to
my
brothers
name
and
people
would
confuse
us
o
o
oooookay
so
first
legal
name
is
sharifa
its
swahili
and
means
honorable
and
noble
my
middle
name
is
jasara
meaning
pure
at
heart
so
those
who
know
me
as
sharifa
have
nick
names
from
rif
thanks
to
cheech
from
work
this
is
what
most
call
me
at
the
j
o
b
rifa
haha
i
am
sure
you
can
imagine
the
conotations
along
with
this
one
rif
dog
which
was
what
the
husband
typically
calls
me
and
for
those
who
know
me
as
jasara
well
jay
jazzie
and
jaas
have
all
come
into
play
and
ofcourse
mom
by
my
kiddos
it
is
very
funny
not
laugh
out
loud
funny
although
sarge
and
hedgie
do
with
the
exception
of
the
stinky
cheese
episode
but
titter
funny
i
enjoy
a
wildly
funny
book
some
favorites
being
p
j
o'rourke's
works
holidays
in
and
give
war
a
chance
to
name
a
couple
and
woody
allen's
without
feathers
i
have
been
known
to
laugh
myself
giddy
over
those
not
so
three
men
and
i
suppose
i
will
leave
it
at
that
also
this
post
is
prepared
ahead
of
time
and
i
m
telling
you
this
and
ruining
the
illusion
because
i
m
seeing
the
hunger
games
tonight
and
i
m
very
very
excited
i
will
probably
be
exuberant
about
it
tomorrow
if
you
catch
me
on
g
facebook
or
twitter
i
read
the
entire
trilogy
a
few
weeks
ago
and
i
loved
it
the
movie
looks
amazing
i
m
kind
of
squeeing
at
least
as
much
as
my
sardonic
and
stoic
countenance
can
squee
we
pulled
into
a
lookout
with
a
view
of
the
hollywood
valley
a
couple
of
kids
in
the
car
next
to
us
were
making
out
i
hoped
howard
didn
t
have
any
ideas
i
wasn
t
ready
to
let
our
relationship
go
that
far
yet
so
she
came
running
to
simon
peter
and
the
other
disciple
the
one
jesus
loved
and
said
they
have
taken
the
lord
out
of
the
tomb
and
we
don
t
know
where
they
have
put
him
so
peter
and
the
other
disciple
started
for
the
tomb
both
were
running
but
the
other
disciple
outran
peter
and
reached
the
tomb
first
he
bent
over
and
looked
in
at
the
strips
of
linen
lying
there
but
did
not
go
in
then
simon
peter
came
along
behind
him
and
went
straight
into
the
tomb
he
saw
the
strips
of
linen
lying
there
as
well
as
the
cloth
that
had
been
wrapped

how
about
you
stop
spoiling
before
i
can
eat
you
i
have
managed
to
throw
away
wonderful
food
stuffs
out
of
my
refridgerator
all
because
i
didn
t
have
the
time
nor
memory
to
eat
you
if
you
never
went
bad
this
would
not
be
a
problem
all
action
movie
heroes
are
superhuman
because
they
do
the
impossible
and
usually
do
it
alone
the
quality
of
an
action
movie
then
comes
down
to
how
believably
these
men
and
women
can
achieve
unbelievable
things
by
this
measure
the
black
pirate
is
a
success
its
star
douglas
fairbanks
does
it
all
and
because
he
is
fairbanks
athlete
lover
fighter
thinker
we
always
buy
it
there
is
however
one
thing
even
he
cannot
do
and
that
s
carry
scenes
he
isn
t
in
and
unfortunately
for
us
there
s
a
few
too
many
of
those
in
the
black
pirate
i
know
the
whole
traditional
vs
self
publishing
thing
is
a
hot
button
right
now
there
are
people
on
both
sides
who
are
completely
convinced
that
choosing
one
path
over
the
other
may
equate
to
writer
cide
erm
read
death
of
your
writing
career
by
way
of
foolhardy
decision
making
when
one
does
well
in
traditional
that
is
the
path
you
should
take
when
a
bestseller
comes
from
the
independent
side
that
is
the
path
you
should
choose
ben
has
built
the
harvest
around
the
backbone
of
his
bridge
road
australian
ale
and
that
in
itself
is
a
fair
base
to
work
from
aiming
in
a
way
for
that
rich
strength
of
flavour
and
aroma
found
in
many
good
us
and
new
zealand
craft
beers
the
harvest
delivers
in
bucket
loads
this
may
be
due
to
the
amount
as
well
as
the
quality
of
this
new
hop
as
ben
told
me
had
to
keep
adding
more
hop
flowers
and
ended
up
throwing
pellets
at
it
as
well
wasn
t
getting
enough
from
the
whole
flowers
and
was
worried
about
getting
them
out
of
the
tank
this
is
total
bunk

said
how
clothes
fit
just
getting
tighter
and
tighter
as
my
wardrobe
quickly
shrinks
down
to
about
5
different
outfits
luckily
i
rotate
through
the
same
few
work
outfits
every
day
so
it
only
gets
frustrating
on
the
weekends
when
i
m
trying
to
wear
my
real
clothes
it
looks
like
skirts
and
dresses
may
be
the
way
to
go
this
summer
now
i
just
have
to
re
sell
those
flights
to
get
my
500
bucks
back
that
is
really
my
only
out
of
pocket
expense
as
the
best
nail
polish
ever
this
is
2
days
worth
of
work
i
have
just
about
finished
with
the
pencil
rendering
some
trees
to
be
added
to
the
horizon
then
it
will
be
sealed
then
i
will
get
into
the
acrylic
washes
i
am
working
with
it
leaning
up
against
the
dining
table
while
i
sit
on
the
floor
in
front
probably
not
the
best
way
to
go
about
it
but
i
could
not
get
it
on
the
easel
at
the
right
height
to
sit
at
the
canvas
is
91cm
square
and
i
intend
to
have
a
fair
bit
of
white
space
i
have
not
worked
out
how
i
am
going
to
incorporate
the
text
of
the
poem
yet
though
what
style
writing
and
whether
i
should
do
it
in
pencil
or
pen
and
ink
though
i
think
it
should
be
either
grey
or
sepia
toned
beauty's
hair
seems
to
be
taking
on
a
slightly
tree
like
look
which
i
quite
like
though
it
was
not
intentional
i
struggled
with
the
folds
of
the
sheet
though
i
really
can
not
do
draping
cloth
it
has
to
be
finished
by
the
end
of
the
week
so
no
time
to
stop
and
procrastinate
about
which
way
i
should
go
which
is
probably
a
blessing

jp
told
me
tonight
at
dinner
that
roger
our
contractor
made
some
mention
about
how
i
come
across
as
intimidatingly
smart
this
shocked
me
because
1
i
do
not
think
i
am
at
all
intimidating
for
any
reason
and
have
actually
worried
in
professional
opposing
party
type
situations
that
i
come
off
as
too
friendly
and
2
the
only
conversations
i
have
had
with
roger
involve
measurements
and
picturing
things
that
are
not
yet
built
and
i
am
absolutely
terrible
at
that
we
had
to
put
a
piece
of
paper
on
the
floor
and
draw
a
diagram
of
our
master
shower
from
two
different
perspectives
that
is
how
much
i
could
not
grasp
the
concept
of
our
new
bench
i
think
it
must
be
because
he
is
only
seen
me
in
suits
and
heels
whereas
he
sees
jp
working
in
burnt
orange
basketball
shorts
and
a
t
shirt
the
same
burnt
orange
basketball
shorts
and
t
shirt
ever
single
day
i
had
to
explain
last
night
that
working
from
home
is
not
an
excuse
to
forgo
bathing
and
laundry
and
sniffled
in
spite
of
himself
there
were
second
place
finishes
in
argentina
san
marino
and
britain
and
fine
performances
led

logan
has
continued
to
grow
so
much
in
the
vocabulary
department
in
fact
during
our
visit
to
oregon
this
past
weekend
i
swear
he
learned
10
more
words
he
regularly
talks
about
elmo
and
his
favorite
sesame
street
friends
and
is
also
verbalizing
his
favorite
foods
peas
blues
berries
cheese
wa
wa
and
lets
us
know
when
he
has
finished
by
saying
 
ah
duh
he
also
has
picked
up
a
couple
other
phrases
such
as
happy
bees
a
favorite
song
in
our
house
and
 
bye
mama
and
i
of
you
and
the
best
of
all
over
the
past
week
he
has
begun
searching
for
one
of
us
saying
mama
are
you
his
little
voice
is
just
so
sweet
and
most
of
all
i
love
love
love
how
he
has
an
ear
to
ear
smile
when
he
knows
he
is
being
heard
and
understood
it
feels
that
all
we
are
doing
is
clapping
and
praising
just
as
it
should
be
in
raising
little
ones
seldom
as
we
ll
assume
that
they
should
their
responsibility
the
city
purse
needs
to
hug
close
to
my
body
when
i
am
digging
through
bins
at
my
favorite
gw
outlet
or
trying
on
shoes
at
the
nordstrom
rack
and
it
needed
to
distribute
weight
evenly
when
i
am
walking
downtown
i
spent
some
time
in
the
toggery
yesterday
making
sure
photos
were
turned
right
side
up
and
everything
was
in
it
s
proper
place
i
could
spend
a
week
in
this
room
everything
should
be
moved
and
cleaned
under
and
around
there
are
boxes
and
even
some
old
suitcases
shoved
under
displays
that
contain
clothing
and
hat
boxes
galore
i
really
need
a
volunteer
to
adopt
this
room
too

who
is
as
energetic

excited

the
death
of

considered

i
know
his
death
is
a

many
but
these
videos
are
a

scary

be

do

single
one
of
you
who
thinks
that
they
are
 
training
 
their
children
to
ride
in
town
by
doing
this
should
be
cited
for
gross
child
endangerment
i
cannot
tell
you
how
many
times
i
have
seen
the
following
scenarios
i
made
the
pesto
threw
the
sandwiches
on
the
griddle
and
by
the
time
i
was
done
loading
the
dishwasher
i
had
perfect
italian
sandwich
love
ready
for
eating
now
that
is
my
kind
of
dinner
folks
the
other
night
frank
was
watching
that
new
zombie
series
on
amc
the
walking
dead
at
one
point
a
10yo
boy
spots
his
zombified
mother
outside
the
house
he
bursts
into
tears
and
his
father
tries
to
quiet
him
because
hey
if
the
zombies
hear
them
things
are
going
to
get
what
was
interesting
was
that
the
scriptwriters
chose
to
have
the
father
respond
compassionately
he
snuggled
his
son
close
spoke
in
loving
tones
and
offered
the
boy
a
pillow
so
he
could
cry
into
that
when
triggered
i
experience
a
lot
of
pain
however
time
has
done
wonders
for
my
affliction
there
was
a
time
when
there
were
more
foods
i
could
not
eat
than
ones
i
could
now
it
s
hard
for
me
to
find
a
food
that
i
can
t
eat
do
you
think
the
government
as
a
corporation
cares
one
ounce
whether
or
not
a
mom
and
pop
store
closes
its
doors
after
30
years
in
business
no
it
either
already
owns
the
land
and
building
that
business
is
on
or
is
interested
in
buying
it
once
the
shops
go
out
of
business
land
ownership
is
the
goal
not
some
meager
monthly
rent
power
comes
with
ownership
beware
of
the
dog
after
discussing
the
practical
difficulties
in
translation
as
each
language
has
some
etymological
nuances
that
cannot
be
exactly
translated
he
explained
the
importance
of
translation
with
the
following
examples
that
small
amount
of
selfless
sacrifice
carried
me
through
the
routine
until
it
came
time
to
blow
dry
my
hair
i
stood
in
front
of
the
mirror
trying
as
hard
as
humanly
possible
not
to
wonder
if
the
acid
slime
monster
was
going
to
drop
from
the
ceiling
onto
my
head
my
mind
is
the
sort
that
dwells
on
things
you
see
it
s
not
enough
for
me
to
frighten
myself
by
reading
about
demons
and
ghosts
and
acid
slime
monsters
no
my
mind
constantly
returns
to
their
horrific
existence
and
most
frequently
it
does
this
when
i
m
alone
you
want
to
know
the
real
reason
i
still
live
at
home
there
it
is
i
am
afraid
to
be
alone
the
slime
monster
in
phantoms
had
devoured
its
victims
by
spraying
them
with
corrosive
acid
my
imagination
drifted
again
as
i
thought
about
the
phrase
corrosive
acid
i
pictured
myself
caught
unawares
face
contorted
in
terror
as
a
slimy
oozy
terrifying
thing
descended
upon
me
would
it
eat
my
hands
first
to
prevent
me
scraping
it
off
i
wondered
or
would
it
immediately
dissolve
my
face
burning
me
horribly
and
destroying
my
gorgeousness
maybe
it
would
slither
around
my
ankles
and
then
slurp
its
way
up
onto
my
torso
or
what
if
it
jumped
out
from
behind
the
that
s
right
we
said
30
off
everything
for
a
store
that

big

the

my

designer
and
our
son
tate
is
in
first
grade
at
the
school
where
i
teach

live

system

special
jigsaw
puzzle
and
receiving
the
best
score
in
the
autumn
some
people
can
call
up
clearly
in
their
mind's
eye
the
vision
of
what
a
certain
landscape
looked
like
in
the
spring
it
is
natural
for
them
to
notice
these
things
and
to
make
these
comparisons
or
associations
when
they
are
talking
to
people
they
do
not
attend
very
particularly
to
the
tones
of
the
voice
and
they
are
perhaps
not
particularly
interested
in
what
is
being
said
but
they
are
watching
and
remembering
and
comparing
what
other
people
never
notice
at
all
even
in
the
faces
of
people
that
they
love
the
movement
of
the
eyelids
the
little
tricks
of
the
lips
the
poise
and
movement
of
the
head
and
so
on
used
a
thief
to
continue
what
he
began
in
eden
the
messiah
must
come
jesus
must
be
born
in
bethlehem
esau
forfeited
the
birthright
and
did
not
tell
jacob
you
need
to
return
the
birthright
to
the
rightful
owner
give
it
back
to
esau
i
cannot
work
with
this
the
animals
agreed
that
this
made
sense
there
was
no
reason
a
pineapple
should
challenge
a
hare
unless
it
had
a
clever
plan
of
some
sort
so
the
animals
wanting
to
back
a
winner
all
cheered

i
feel
like
i
am
being
urged
to
be
still
and
listen
i
have
spent
so
much
of
my
life
making
decisions
for
me
rarely
thinking
about
the
fact
that
only
he
knows
what
is
best
for
my
life
and
that
he
has
a
better
plan
for
me
true
to
child
form
i
have
made
so
many
mistakes
but
through
all
this
i
am
learning
i
am
learning
to
be
still
to
listen
and
to
wait
to
find
out

is

note
i
received
a
review
copy
of
this
book
from
the
publisher
but
was
under
no
obligation
to
post
a
review
my
comments
as
always
are
my
own
my
neice
is
on
facebook
she
is
kinda
bent
out
of
shape
talking
obliquely
about
her
son
and
a
mysterious
label
i
send
her
a
note
the
story
of
jesus
is
a
very
beautiful
one
it
is
the
story
of
the
of
all
gods
who
had
a
change
of
heart
towards
mankind
and
it
is
during
this
change
of
heart
that
he
decided
he
would
change
the
way
things
were
for
the
better
once
and
for
all
knowing
that
only
the
blood
of
the
most
powerful
could
save
mankind
from
unworthiness
and
judgment
he
sent
his
son
into
the
world
for
the
human
race
in
an
effort
to
show
he
would
sacrifice
his
own
son
if
it
meant
the
eternal
pardon
of
mankind
from
unworthiness
and
judgment
and
on
his
son's
flesh
and
bone
were
embedded
all
the
pitfalls
and
downfalls
of
mankind
by
his
son's
blood
all
sin
was
dismissed
for
all
time
the
veil
separating
from
man
was
torn
and
from
that
day
on
mankind
has
never
been
unworthy
the
price
was
paid
and
the
ultimate
sacrifice
was
made
the
only
part
that
humanity
had
to
take
in
this
grand
plan
was
to
only
believe
that
it
all
happened
and
why

i
wanted
to
share
with
you
what
our
county
does
each
year
for
our
children
each
school
in
the
county
has
a
health
fair
students
from
the
university
of
alabama
come
in
mass
and
do
all
kinds
of
screenings
on
our
children
fundamentally
the
producer
s
job
is
to
help
you
achieve
the
recording
that
you
and
your
label
set
out
to
make
this
may
sound
like
the
engineer
s
role
but
many
elements
other
than
purely
sonic
clarity
go
into
the
crafting
of
your
final
product
on
the
music
side
of
things
these
may
include
songwriting
and
arrangement
adjustments
as
well
as
coaching
musicians
and
coaxing
peak
musical
performances
in
the
control
room
there
are
decisions
to
be
made
about
sonic
treatment
and
creative
mixes
while
style
and
popular
idiom
must
be
addressed
in
anticipation
of
marketing
the
disc
in
short
the
producer
must
keep
an
eye
on
the
big
picture
the
engineer
is
already
quite
busy
with
the
technical
side
of
things
and
isn
t
necessarily
listening
with
a
view
to
the
ultimate
creative
goals
of
the
project
further
recognize
that
it
is
extremely
hard
for
any
artist
to
maintain
this
view
while
in
the
thick
of
recording
this
view
requires
an
objectivity
which
is
unfair
to
expect
of
yourself
while
pouring
your
heart
into
your
performances
in
essence
the
producer
is
there
to
help
keep
you
on
track
the
producer
is
the
go
between
translating
the
artists
needs
the
engineers
technical
point
of
view
and
sometimes
the
label
s
interests
aka
has
recently
added
a
number
of
new
sakes
to
their
list
such
as
the
sato
no
homare
pride
of
the
village
for
10
glass
and
the
hakushika
yamadanishiki
for
6
glass
the
sato
no
homare
is
a
favorite
of
mine
made
in
a
sake
brewery
that
is
over
860
years
old
what
a
taste
of
history
those
who
opposed
the
matthew
shepard
act
in
the
manner
they
did
were
defeated
because
it
is
indefensible
to
argue
that
a
law
should
not
protect
a
particular
group
however
that
is
what
the
law
already
does
and
why
the
law
itself
is
indefensible
the
exclusion
of
whites
from
the
protection
of
hate
crimes
legislation
is
indefensible
and
results
entirely
from
bigotry
and
racial
prejudice
on
the
part
of
the
left
wing
zealots
who
drafted
the
law
vivuli
maybe
we
should
sell
this
mine
before
anyone
figures

one
of

was
under
repair
causing
the
twelve
member
administrative
crew
to
pile
on
the
entertainers
bus
for
the
two
mile
ride
to
the

it
was
uncomfortable
i
thought
if
i
survive
all
this
i
ll
go
to
the
house
apologies
to
the
mother
and
accept
whatever
punishment
she
chooses
for
me
prison
death
it
didn
t
matter
because
at
least
i
wouldn

be
in

but
then
like
a
flash
it
came
to
me
man
maybe
that
s
what
is
an
entire
eternity
spent
in
bruges
q
medical
problems
waiting
for
the
day
with
excellent
cutting
when
he
died
my
sisters
and
i
were
to
go
through
his
house
alone
and
pick
whatever
we
wanted
we
had
passed
through
his
empty
cold
kitchen
checked
the
fridge
for
beer
and
sure
enough
no
food
either
and
through
a
yellow
blanketed
door
the
blanket
that
used
to
close
in
his
side
of
the
bedroom
at
the
old
farmhouse
when
we
were
little
toddlers
and
into
his
room
a
bare
mattress
like
before
i
remember
thinking
of
the
time
i
broke
into
his
house
when
i
was
in
my
teens
because
i
was
angry
because
my
stepfather
was
watching
me
shower
and
because
i
had
recurring
memories
of
molestation
from
the
early
early
years
i
was
angry
angry
because
he
left
us
because
he
left
us
defenseless
to
him
because
he
was
a
serious
alcoholic
because
he
had
been
so
scared
and
shy
and
gentle
when
we
were
so
little
we
got
what
we
wanted
he
shushed
us
he
was
too
embarrassed
to
help
us
in
the
bath
grandma
helen
had
to
wash
us
because
when
he
tried
to
quit
drinking
in
order
to
have
visiting
rights
he
showed
up
at
our
house
in
tears
because
he
couldn
t
and
because
he
wanted
us
our
parents
were
at
the
door
talking
to
him
and
my
sisters
huddled
in
the
kitchen
listening
and
crying
and
looking
at
each
other
we
weren
t
thinking
he
couldn
t
do
it
we
were
thinking
he
still
wants
us
someone
truly
wants
us
they
re
crying
for
us
when
he
went
away
rejected
we
went
up
to
our
rooms
in
the
creaky
house
and
sat
by
ourselves
i
wasn
t
surprised
that
he
couldn
t
stop
my
mother
had
told
us
how
it
was
a
disease
i
was
surprised
that
after
these
ten
years
he
still
wanted
us
enough
so
that
he
cried
and
as
we
went
through
his
messy
room
we
bee
lined
it
for
his
closet
and
each
took
out
a
shirt
smelled
it
and
sobbed
it
was
hardest
for
nikki
my
older
sister
i
d
never
seen
her
like
that
before
in
shock
her

she
was

actually
for
awhile
he
denied

i

she
was

bertien
van
manen
started
out
as
a

photographer
and
she
still
has
an
eye
for
detail
and
pattern
but
inspired
by
robert
frank's
book
the
americans
1958
she
decided
on
a
more
documentary
approach
for
a
time
she
photographed
in
black
and
white
but
she
changed
her
style
radically
in
the
early
1990s
from
that
point
on
she
travelled
with
great
regularity
through
eastern
europe
and
asia
her
many
travels
and
intensive
contact
with
the
people
she
met
resulted
in

i
come

b
1938
i
have
to
admit
that
i
ve
only
read
one
of
his
books
but
it
was
a
great
one
grand
days
the
first
of
his

franklin
moorhouse
is
another
of
our
outspoken
writers
he
has
been
arrested
for
campaigning
against
censorship
but
for
me
as
a
librarian
his
main
claim
on
my
memory
comes
from
his
copyright
infringement
case
against
the
university
of
new
south
wales
library
in
1973
the
library
authorised
the
making
of
photocopies
of
pages
from
his
book
the
americans
baby
the
court
found
that
the
university
had
infringed
his
copyright
setting
in
motion
changes
both
to
the
copyright
act
and
to
the
management
of

as
much
as
i
loved
grand
days
it
is
moorhouse
s
impact
on
copyright
practice
in
australia
that
i
ll
never
forget
along
with
the
well
publicized
rise
in
the
price
of
hops
and
malt
which
is
pretty
much
world
wide
lower
values
of
the
dollar
vs
the
euro
and
other
currencies
mean
that
beers
from
europe
asia
and
yes
canada
cost
more
than
they
did
a

wonder
if
that
is
affected

questions
that
fill
my
mind
when
i
look
at
a
house
especially
an
old
house
here
we
get
another
family
tree
this
as
dry
and
female
less
as
the
last
one
here
we
see
the
lifespan
of
man
or
at
least
these
named
men
dramatically
decreasing
when
compared
to
their
ancestors
it
may
be
that
after
the
flood
life
and
the
local
environment
wasn
t
as
friendly
for
humanity
or
that
following
up
on
his
proclamation
in
genesis

i
worked
at
a
juvenile
arthritis
conference
in
phoenix
7
the
vogues
just
what
i
have
been
looking
for
anyway
the
sun
s
been
shining
for
a
few
days
now
and
so
i
m
going
to
have
to
ask
mr
young
to
get
the
boxes
down
from
the
top
of
my
wardrobe
so
i
can
take
out
all
the
little
creased
bundles
and
stuff
in
all
my
winter
clothes
instead
let's
imagine
that
social
conditions
are
far
better
for
people
of
one
colour
than
another
that
perhaps
one
race
has
access
to
better
schools
or
that
there
are
areas
that
the
other
race
is
not
permitted
to
go
maybe
there
is
also
financial
inequality
it
seemed
to
be
one
thing
on
top
of
another
almost
as
if
the
universe
was
conspiring
against
us
and
trying
to
get
us
to
break
so
i
looked
at
the
ballot
paper
i
had
my
family
and
kirsty
there
on
the
san
diego
dock
upon
arrival
so
it
was
especially
great
getting
in
to
see
everyone
we
found
we
had
another
fan
of
ocean
watch
and
around
the
americas
project
in
bill
walton
the
great
basketball
center
who
is
quite
an
environmental
activist
he
had
many
insightful
words
about
our
oceans
and
the
state
of
the
planet
and
gave
us
a
great
boost
of
energy
when
we
were
just
a
little
depleted
sleep
outside
in
the
tents
for
the
sake
of
love
he
listened

my
friend
told
me
much
more
of
the
story
with
my
urging
and
i
was
totally
captivated
if
you
like
a
story
about

with
a
little
bit
of

a

story
and
messing

as
doc

you
would

this
book
that
is
not

sad

i
came
to
be
a
writer
in
a
circuitous
way
i
was
going
for
a
master
s
degree
in
counselling
and
development
and
my
professor
suggested
i
become
a
writer
he
said
he
loved
the
voice
in
my
research
papers
i
finished
my
degree
but
also
started
taking
writing
courses
i
had
always
wanted
to
be
a
writer
but
life
took
down
other
paths
losing
weight

to

always
kept

at
the
ready
along
with
scraps
of
material
for
them
to
sew
when
they
asked
they
would
sit
for
what
seemed
like
hours
pushing
a
needle
through
fabric
back
and
forth
until
they
had
created

my

had

the

when

of

itself
which
has
been
spread
like

over

equally
a

then
the

shortly
after
scannell
himself
got
into
a
lorry
and
started
driving
foolish
really
he
did
not
shave
and
when
he
was
asked
his
business
he
could
not
give
a
soldierly
answer
so
got
arrested
he
was
not
being
an
officer
sent
to
a
prison
in
north
africa
every
day
the
men
carted
a
huge
pile
of
sand
from
one
corner
of
the
parade
ground
to
the
opposite
corner
the
next
day
they
took
it
back
in
solitary
confinement
he
was
given
a
hunk
of
bread
in
the
morning
he
kept
some
of
it
for
later
and
was
disciplined
for
hoarding
food
so
much
better
i
kept
the
white
console
table
my
dad
built
for
me
and
moved

the

filled

with

set

for

passing

again
were
welcomed
by

to
whom
they
recounted
their

to

saltan
nor
did
they
fail
to
tell
how
he
had
purposed
to
sail
thither
until
he
had
heard
of
the
fir

the

and
the
nuts
of

one
thing
is
i
have
no
idea
how
to
get
rid
of
the
flour
on
the
surface
and
the
sides
of
the
mooncakes
it
should
have
looked
much
prettier
without
it
i
guess
i
have
dusted
the
mould
with
too
much
flour
and
it
looked
more

abby
had

that
her
co
workers
seemed
to
share
from
her
tiny
cube
in

she
could
see
three
burly
men
chugging
down
the
black
sludge
without
even
cringing
if
it
weren

for
that
last

last

she
wouldn
t
even
be
contemplating
drinking
this

it
seemed

that
she
was
going

without

aid
thats
it
i
never
know
how
to
finish
posts
so
all
i
can
say
now
is
to
anyone
not
saved
reading
this
please
think
about
it
and
those
who
are
maybe
it
is
time
to
reach
out
to
people
more
i
hope
to
try
to
do
that
myself
when
you
are
ready

at

flour
a

and
place

on
it

i
am
very
much
aware
of
the
lessons
i
learned
in
that
freshman
year
7
30
am
history
class
about
clarity
in
writing
and
still
seek
to
be
as
clear
as
i
can
be
each
week
as
i
am
getting
set
to
write
my
new
book
i
am
facing
a
lot
of
options
far
too
many
i
had
originally
wanted
to
write
an
internal
drama
with
four
characters
we'd
know
in
the
beginning
when
each
of
those
characters
died
but
we
would
not
know
what
the
impact
of
those
deaths
would
be
at
the
same
time
so
many
people
died
in
cyberlama
that
i
am
curious
to
try
and
write
a
book
where
nobody
dies
i
am
also
playing
with
the
idea
of
collage
taking
real
speech
from
real
people
or
fusing
headlines
from
news
stories
into
my
prose
and
as
i
have
mentioned
over
the
last
few
days
i
am
experimenting
with
more
flowery
prose

mcarthur
found
there
was
no
work
in
liberia
he
took
a
bus
from
monrovia
to
dakar
1
174km
3
days
in
search
of
something
better
after
dakar
did
not
work
out
for
mcarthur
he
booked
another
bus
ticket
right
down
the
artery
of
the
ear
of
africa
dakar
to
accra
2
139km
6
days
every
time
the
bus
braked
he
would
be
flung
into
the
stairwell
swathes
of
dust
billowed
for
100hours
through
the
dishevelled
exterior
right
into
mcarthur's
nose
he
held
screaming
babies
for
their
weary
mothers
and
avoided
conversation
as
he
was
assumed
a
local
who
could
at
least
speak
french
he
could
not
and
in
all
five
countries
the
bus
braked
to
a
rattling
halt
mcarthur
was
flung
into
the
dusty
stairwell
because
that
is
the
seat
he
was
allocated
on
his
ticket
now
greedy
soldiers
toss
out
dice
to
see
who
gets
the
bragging
rights
of
owning
the
traditional
garment
she
lovingly
created
for
her
son
when
he
left
home
the
garment
saturated
with
the
perfumed
oil
of
spikenard
from
the
broken
alabaster
passion
box
the
interesting
implication
we
can
investigate
is
what
psychological
needs
are
addressed
here
why
do
we
need
this
or
that
form
of
sacrum
it
is
only
a
trick
to
say
now
we
are
past
the
medieval
ages
now
we
know
what
the
world
is
made
of
yet
we
haven
t
overcome
our
own
thinking
and
we
never
will
here
is
a
reminder
be
critical
with
special
emphasis
on
not
being
overly
rational
the
modern
world
is
too
complex
to
think
we
already
know
how
to
deal
with
it
the
400
years
old
manner
of
questioning
it
is
not
valid
anymore
by
definition
the
traps
are
in
places
that
we
don
t
expect
we
ve
already
fallen
deep
inside
but
our
duty
is
to
try
climbing
a
little
bit
higher
at
least
high
enough
to
see
the
light
to
some
it
is
napoleon
to
some
it
is
a
philosophical
struggle

me

a

asked
me
if
we
were
allowed
to
possess

nuclear
chemical
and
biological
weapons
i
said
to
him
yes
we
must
possess
such
weapons
but
not
use
them
we
must
possess
such
weapons
in
order
to
strike
terror
in
our
enemies
strike
terror
in
the
hearts
of
the
enemies
and
frighten
them
if
we
had
nuclear
weapons
they
would
be
afraid
to
attack
us
as
was
the
case
between
the
soviet

and
the

and
between

this

a
few

ago
i
did
a

post
on

here
since
then
i
have
bought
and
used
the
collection

concealer
that
i
have
so
often
had
recommended
i
decided
that
the
whole
world
or
at
least
those
who
are
interested
in
it
and
love
such
puffs
might
take
part
in
the
pleasure
of
touching
the
soft
fabric
and
discover
the
surprisingly
bright
colours
on
the
backside
of
the
faded
front
i
kept
some
panels
of
6
12
or
24
puffs
for
sale
the
rest
ended
up
in
single
puffs
for
thus

the
problem

can

stated
what
role
should
luck
play
in
the
moral
assessment
of
someone
s
actions

and
so
on
luck
can
be
roughly
defined
as
any

state
of

that
is

the

of
the

being

overly

with
an
underwhelming
pils
flavor
what
this
also
means
is
that
there
will
be
no
shortage
of
classic

discs
this
year
because
in
addition
to
the
newest
releases
here
in
the
states
we
re
still
behind
on
some
half
dozen
or
more
discs
so
we
need
to
catch
up
on
those
as
well
this
month
s
catch
up
title
is
the
dominators
for
at
least
the
first
half
of
the
year
every
month
we
should
be
getting
no
less
than
two
releases
so
if
you
re
someone
who
collects
all
of
these
you
d
better
start
pinching
some
pennies
on
the
other
hand
if
you
re
someone
who
just
wants
to
pick
up
the

i

be
here

letting

and
came
up
to
chat
with
us
at
the

of

and
talked
about
various

we
should
check
out

get
that
it
s
tougher
to
convince
teenagers
to
make
healthy
choices
when
they
are
working
very
hard
to
distinguish
themselves
from
the
adults
in
their
lives
not
to
mention
they
feel
invincible
so
most
aren
t
worried
about
their
health
but
throwing
up
our
collective
hands
and
offering
high

students
cookies
and
french
fries
for
every
meal
surely
isn
t
an
option

tell

that

s
journey
has
followed
a
trajectory
all
of
its
own
after
stumbling
across
the
music
of
sidney
bechet
at
the
age
of
15
he
formed
a
band
and
began
dreaming
of
running
his
own

label
half
a
century
ago
he
was
among
the
r
b
fans
getting
a
first
taste
of
the
beatles
at
the
star
club
in
hamburg
soon
afterwards
he
produced
some
of
the
first
tracks
by
the
pop
group

as
he
embarked
on
a
career
as
a

executive
between
christina's
birth
and
death
exists
a
timeline
of
trends
that
could
foreshadow
disaster
after
september
11th
the
fundamental
rifts
between
american
political
parties
deepened
and
quickly
grew
toxic
platforms
for
incendiary
rhetoric
became
commonplace
as
media
grew
less
objective
and
more
partisan
wars
were
started
abroad
to
supposedly
protect
the
homeland
while
morally
and
financially
draining
it
the
rich
grew
richer
and
the
middle
class
became
poor
and
the
backlash
toward
foreigners
in
a
country
of
immigrants
showed
a
very
hateful
xenophobic
side
of
americans
particularly
in
arizona
ok
when
was
the
last
time
you
had
for
forty
more
i
fed

past
this
verse
has
become
my
prayer
this
christmas
season
that
i
would
make
the
time
to
give
priority
to
rejoicing
being
glad
in
s
presence
and
letting
my
inner
joy
show

may

wonderfully

ale
is
dry
hopped
for
a
lively
intense
aroma
brewed
especially
for
the
holidays
so
i
m
on
the
witness
stand
and
the
nasty
little
defense
attorney
having
utterly
failed
to
shake
my
testimony
mr
sheeran
said
now
you
can
say
you
ve
had
your
first
shakedown
i
remember
it
clearly
decides
to
attack
me
based
on
my
psychiatric
history
which
was
a
big
mistake
i
had
depression
which
is
a
treatable
illness
and
i
sought
and
received
appropriate
treatment
we
went
around
and
around
on
this
later
the
second
chair
prosecutor
told
me
that
he
was
kicking
the
first
chair
under
the
table
and
whispering
object
object
but
the
lead
attorney
s
position
was
that
i
was
handling
it
just
fine
and
i
didn
t
need
him
to
interrupt
i
finally
turned
to
the
judge
and
said
already
asked
and
answered
your
honor
and
the
judge
ordered
the
defense
attorney
to
move
on
but
he
had
nothing
to
move
on
to
back
in
the
prosecutor
s
office
they
were
gleefully
declaring
that
it
was
just
like
perry

again
here
are
the
details
of
the
event
next
headhunters

sloppy

the
warning
was
made
because
of
recent
intelligence
reports
explaining
the
risk
of
a

the

stores
all
across
america
saw
a

in

of

because
duct

sold
out
in
many
places
the
incident
became
known
as
the
duct

alert
this
is
the
only
time
in
the
interview
when
borg
speaks
like
the
politician
he
claims
not
to
be
when
i
look
at
other
politicians
i
tend
to
see
myself
more
as
an
economist
he
says
this
is
true
in
that
he
is
appointed
not
elected
and
was
chief
economist
for
seb
bank
but
before
this
he
was
a
young
libertarian
longing
to
turn
the
world
upside
down
internet
footage
still
exists
of
a
denim
clad
borg
declaring
on
television
that
if
he
was
prime
minister
he
wouldn
t
do
a
thing
so
the
people
could
do
whatever
they
want
when
he
later
became
a
prime
ministerial
adviser
he
caused
a
stir
when
it
emerged
that
a
government
staffer
backed
drug
legalisation
polarized
has
a
silver
base
colour
that
is
filled
with
multi
coloured
glitter
mixed
about
unlike
many
of
the
other
polishes
in
this
collection
the
silver
base
of
polarized
does
not
have
any
colour
shifting
i'd
wake
up
one
morning
and
find
nothing
to
rearrange
my
immediate
interest
is
not
to
comment
on
the
article
itself
but
to
focus
on
the
letter
from
mr
bloch
who
wrote

i
am
not
saying
that
everything
needs
to
be
done
in
the
utmost
manner
of
politeness
but
there
does
deserve
to
be
some
simple
respect
even
when
the
stakes
are
high
maybe
especially
when
the
stakes
are
high
but
somewhere
we
seem
to
have
forgotten
that
if
you
are
going
to
tread
on
someone
in
any
arena
that
they
will
make
it
their
mission
to
take
you
down
and
they
too
have
long
memories
even
armies
who
are
bent
on
killing
each
other
understand
that
once
you
have
defeated
your
opponent
you
have
to
give
them
some
grace
in
defeat
or
it
will
come
back
to
haunt
the
victors
i
will
add
i
love
the
heady
topics
the
storylines
about
life
and
death
and
all
the
questions
we
don
t
have
answers
for
it
leaves
room
for
imagination
and
by
extension
good
stories
point
being
i
m
not
entirely
sure
what
made
me
move
to
the
comment
section
of
a
recent
article
about
mel
gibson
s
rants
against
a
jewish
writer
the
article
outlined
gibson
s
verbal
barrages
while
vacationing
with
several
families
the
son
of
the
writer
recorded
some
of
them
and
they
included
him
shouting
about
his
ex
wife
and
calling
her
a
filthy
name
which
i
can
t
bring
myself
to
even
type
other
than
saying
it
is
a
reference
to
being
sexually
serviced
using
a
slang
word
for
part
of
the
male
anatomy
the
rest
of
the
verbal
assaults
were
not
recorded
so
i
won
t
comment
on
the
racial
hatred
he
supposedly
spewed
aside
from
all
this
we
have
trouble
brewing
with
iran
and
of
course
the
huge
us
deficit
and
debt
which
can
never
realistically
be
repaid
it
s
only
the
severe
problems
in
europe
that
are
currently
deflecting
attention
away
from
the
engine
of
the
ship
two
days
later
on
saturday
i
got
a
phone
call
from
a
best
buy
customer
relations
rep
from
the
corporate
office
and
he
told
me
that
he
had
gotten
the
e
mail
i
had
sent
on
wednesday
right
after
the
laptop
died
he
had
talked
with
the
assistant
manager
who
was
on
duty
on
saturday
at
the
mansfield
store
and
he
said
they
would
exchange
my
computer
i
think
my
chin
really
did
hit
the
floor
i
immediately
prayed
thank
you
i
knew
that
he
had
made
this
happen
the
christian
who
walks
with
the
lord
and
keeps
constant
communion
with
him
will
see
many
reason
for
rejoicing
and
thanksgiving
all
day
long
warren
wiersbe
however
if
i
m
being
honest
with
myself
i
d
much
rather
be
with
the
hawaiians
on
this
and
hang
loose
or
to
quote
my
sister
the
infinitely
wise
starlet
and
calm
the
f
k
down
therefore
when
things
of
a
tough
challenging
nature
come
up
whether
that
s
a
fight
with
said
starlet
a
stressful
moment
in
work
or
the
frustration
i
feel
at
a
horrendous
news
story
then
i
m
going
to
be
handing
it
over
be
warned
this
isn
t
a
quick
fix
to
a
situation
and
i
reckon
it
s
a
lifelong
practice
but
it
is
so
worth
it
to
skim
the
surface
then
how
would
i
feed
my
twitter
addiction

quickly
it

book
a
young

may
want
some
help
fleshing
out
the
principles
presented
that
s
not
all
bad
if
you
know
a
teen
who
is
reading
the
book
you
can
read
it
together
and
discuss
if
you
are
the
teen
you
can
force
some
adult
you
know
to
turn

on

that
just

in

introduce
a

the

here
do
creating
a

i
will
get
back
to
that

how
long
it
took

i

it

knowing
that
for
many

it

in

it

i
never

the

with
the

not

my

didn

it

couldn

why
i
would

then
never

to

that
this

the

of

for

but
for
the
record
massachusetts
judges
rank
47th
among
judicial
salaries
the
notion
that
our
judges
work
less
than
forty
hours
a
week
is
just
plain
false
not
to
mention
that
in
recent
years
filings
in
massachusetts
have
increased
especially
in
cases
of
bankruptcy
eviction
domestic
abuse
etc
while
judiciary
staff
has
been
decreased
judges
have
fewer
law
clerks
to
assist
with
research
and
to
help
prepare
decisions
which
directly
impacts
their
ability
to
deliver
decisions
in
a
timely
manner
the
extended
backlogs
in
approximately
forty
of
the
state
s
courthouses
have
forced
clerks
and

to
reduce
public
hours
of

in

to
get

i
am
just
tired

got
enough
going
on
what
is
it
about
us
that
instinctively
wants
not

cry
narrow
minded
lacking
in
flexibility
or
breadth
of

we
refuse

expand
our

to

junk
food
wreaks
havoc
with

and
the
same
is
true
of
your
mind
allowing
ourselves
to
lose
focus
by
giving
precedence
to
those
things
which
are
not
productive
to

just
screws

sherberty
ballot
access
in
new
york
state
is
difficult
and
candidates
with
large
political
organizations
behind
them
like
grace
meng
has
with
the
queens
county
democratic
party
committee
can
prevent
legitimate
candidates
who
have
demonstrated
a
modicum
of
support
from
getting
on
the
ballot
by
suing
them
in
court
and
causing
them
to
needlessly
expend
legal
and
financial
resources
to
fend
off
challenges
while
new
york's
election
law
provides
for
such
challenges
at
their
heart
they
are
extremely
undemocratic
proceedings
and
any
candidate
that
demonstrates
a
modicum
of
support
should
be
allowed
on
the
ballot
sheng
said
today
belonged
to
my
husband
a
serious
wonderdad
for
us
because
my
own
dad
happened
to
be
out
of
town
for
the
day
but
he
is
not
far
from
my
thoughts
here's
a
small
old
pic
of
a
wee
me
and
my
dad
snoozing
together
my
dad
is
a
master
snoozer
and
this
photo
is
worth
sharing
for
the
couch
alone
i
walked
there
from
my
office
got
a
little
lost
at
the
end
it
is
not
all
descending
numbers
and
avenues
down
there
and
arrived
a
little
breathless
he
was
behind
the
counter
selling
when
he
is
not
drawing
or
inking
he
is
selling
and
he
finished
a
sale
and
was
busy
with
a
couple
who
were
not
sure
about
something
that
is
when
i
have
heard
it
in
his
voice
as
i
have
heard
it
in
my
brothers
 
voices
i
said
earlier
that
paul
was
an
example
of
the
nation
in
rejection
he
is
also
an
example
of
the

i
will

i
wanted
to
do
more
then
just
a
card
and
who
would
not
want
a
gift
on
their
birthday
anyway
so
i
made
this
cute
little
box
filled
with
hershey

it
is
made
so
you
can
fit
dove
chocolates
inside
but
i
went
to
3
different

and
could
not
find
any

pout
i
found
this
tutorial
done
by

from
clearly
istamp
and
instead
of
using
the
biggest
nesties
i
used
my
silhouette
way
easier
for
me
when
it
comes
to
planning
for
a
wedding
everyone
seems
to
have
somewhat
of
an
idea
of
what
they
want
they
either
have
always
dreamed
of
it
they
were
inspired
by
a
movie
scene
or
someone
else
s
wedding
mostly
inspiration
and
the
dream
is
solely
the
bride
s
groom
nods
his
head
to
all
the
selections
colorful
items
and
etc
purchased
at
auction
from

com
today
s
hike
began
with
a
half
mile
walk
through
the
neighborhood
to
reach
the
trailhead
on
lincoln
street
not
visible
on
the
map
at
the
link
provided
but
our
access
was
a
little
left
west
of
what
is
shown
there
following
along
the
edge
of
the
creek
on
the
whatcom
creek
trail
lower
gulch
trail
and
waterline
trails
until
we
reached
the
falls
then
we
turned
around
and
headed
back
the
following

taken
from
her

site
shortly
after
she
was
diagnosed
it
is
so
beautiful
her
father
s
words
are
so
sincere
as
he
speaks
of
elliot
s
determination
from
the
time
she
was
a
little
girl
and
her
unwavering
faith
as
she
has
grown
into
the
woman
she
is
today
have
an
excellent
monday
if
you
are
a
blogger
look
to
the
labels
in
your
blog
seriously
somebody
needs
to
be
fired
for
letting
her
walk
on
stage
in
that
outfit
even
more
seriously
what
in
the
happened
to
her
clearly
something
traumatic
happened
which
explains
her
insane
decision
to
name
one
of
her
twins
moroccan
it
s
true
your
dry
weight
is
almost
completely
corn
derived
in
other
words
the
carbon
atoms
and
various
other
organic
compounds
that
make
up
your
body
were
once
in
a
corn
field
in
iowa
once
we
have
the
two
price
points
in
mind
we
obviously
launch
with
the
introductory
price
we
promote
it
as
an
introductory
price
and
do
not
necessarily
communicate
an
end
date
as
that
gives
us
flexibility
to
change
the
end
date
at
need
per
our
launch
strategy
we
set
the
book
free
for
2
days
trending
shows
that
books
following
the
normal
post
free
cycle
seem
to
hit
their
peak
rank
and
sales
on
day
3
or
day
4
then
begin
a
slow
decay
our
intent
is
to
capitalize
and
maximize
we
want
to
shore
up
royalties
in
the
face
of
the
decline
keeping
the
monetary
base
from
eroding
as
quickly
as
sales
in
theory
this
should
mean
more
money
earned
overall
for
the
books
by
the
time
they
plateau
in
the
week
or
so
after
the
price
change
i
am
talking
about
the
danger
from
parental
anger
or
judgment

so
here
it
is
how
is
that
for

place
concord
california

provided
upon

registration
next
in
line
was
the
lindemans
gueuze
from
belgium
off
the
tap
light
bodied
but
complex
with
a
slightly
intense
sourness
this
was
followed
by
the
boon
kriek
a
100
spontaneously
fermented
ale
with
up
to
300
grams
of
cherries
per
litre
the
resulting
beer
is
a
bright
pink
red
with
a
subtle
tartness
and
lots
of
fizz
that
carries
the
cherry
flavour
nicely
the
inside
of
the
van
was
soaked
but
all
my
change
was
still
in
the
van
and
i
did
not
think
i
had
left
anything
of
value
in
there
no
ipods
or
cell
phones
or
anything
so
i
just
did
a
big
heavy
sigh
and
went
to
pick
them
up
from
under
the
overhang
finally
finish
your
flower
image
using
the
same
steps
for
adding
shadow
and
you
will
have
a
beautiful
flower
full
of
light
and
shadow
which
will
give
it
a
three
dimensional
look
she
walks
into
the
doors
so
cute
our
last
stop
was
culvers
i
ordered
a
small
concrete
vanilla
mixer
with
strawberries
and
bananas
they
ended
up
not
having
bananas
i
was
soo
mad
so
the
girl
gave
me
a
medium
instead
with
extra
strawberries
and
i
thought
since
i
didn
t
get
my
pecans
at
dinner
i
ll
have
them
right
now
so
she
added
pecans
as
well
can
you
say
stuffed
like
a
turkey
that
i
was
almost
uncomfortablly
full
actually
yuck
so
today
i
started
with
coffee
and
lemon
water
lemon
water
is
great
for
detox
the
menu
started
with
12
amuses
in
a
fast
pace
this
past
weekend
was
my
first
saturday
in
many
weeks
that
i
did
not
have
to
get
up
early
for
class
although
it
was
great
to
be
able
to
sleep
in
and
enjoy
the
feeling
of
being
lazy
on
a
saturday
morning
i
felt
as
though
i
was
missing
something
yes
i
miss
the
fun
and
my
new
friends
of
my
public
speaking
class
how
important
is
a
excellent
fluency
regarding
english
for
college
students
today
the
answer
is
it
is
very
important
learning
english
or
every
other
language
online
isn
t
for
everyone
but
even
for
the
people
people
that
chose
a
school
for
understanding
online
resources
generally
is
a
great
supplement
for
your
language
learning
procedure
traveling
around
metropolis
should
be
not
a
problem
since
there
are
quite
a
few
numbers
of
methods
of
transportation
either
your
teacher
or
another
student
should
know
the
phrase
teacherspayteachers
elizabeth
fort
was
built
in
1603
and
was
important
in
the
irish
showdown
of
independence
along
with
the
civil
war
which
will
followed
you
can
do
that
by
extra
studying
or
simply
simply
by
writing
anything
as
you
get
more
vocabulary
start
to
have
much
more
confidence
with
speaking
with
other
english
folks
students
need
tuition
that
connects
grammar
points
with
large
communication
contexts
and
not
larger
grammar
connected
frameworks
if
you
want
to
speak
perfect
english
then
you
certainly
always
need
to
be
effective
on
the
pronunciation
it
is
imperative
not
to
ever
disapprove
of
though
listening
and
for
no
reason
attack
another
person
for
his
her
feelings
next
they
ll
be
trying
to
out
officers
who
are
too
straight
or
too
white
this
was
the
last
thing
that
was
me
my
drawings
they
were
personal
they
showed
me
they
were
pieces
that
i
worked
on
for
hours
upon
hours
they
were
perfected
to
my
liking
they
were
special
according
to
the
dallas
based
electronic
insurance
exchange
workers
compensation
and
commercial
property
experienced
the
greatest
rate
increases
at
four
percent
each
yesterday
my
dear
aunt
turned
100
years
old
awesome
her
children
threw
a
large
birthday
party
for
her
she
was
very
active
in
her
church
and
much
loved
by
all
it
was
so
warm
to
see
how
many
people
care
about
her
i
think
most
would
agree
that
the
best
part
of
this
superhero
simulator
is
simply
getting
around
the
environment
the
original
game
had
two
great
platforming
sequences
one
where
you
scaled
a
prison
and
the
other
where
you
climbed
a
mammoth
tower
in
the
center
of
the
city
both
were
memorable
enjoyable
yet
still
provided
a
bit
of
challenge
how
is
this
possible
well
once
again
more
than
one
button
is
used
x
is
jump
r1
is
fly
but
in
the
end
infamous
uses
far
more
context
sensitive
movement
than
of
war
hop
on
an
electric
wire
and
you
ll
zoom
across
it
but
if
you
jump
on
a
sign
you
ll
scale
it
like
a
raccoon
yet
even
with
most
of
the
platforming
being
context
sensitive
it
still
manages
to
be
engaging
why
because
in
infamous
navigation
is
like
a
dance
and
the
better
you
get
at
platforming
the
quicker
you
traverse
obstacles
not
only
that
but
much
of
infamous
platforming
relies
on
figuring
out
how
you
scale
something
as
opposed
to
the
mechanics
it
choosing
the
route
more
than
completing
it
and
during
sequences
where
you
have
little
choice
such
as
these
set
pieces
the
platforming
requires
precision
if
not
necessarily
much
timing
because
the
game
will
not
simply
shove
you
into
the
direction
of
the
next
handhold
you
can
die
and
fail
easily
in
both
of
these
sections
yet
restarting
is
quick
and
painless
and
when
you
scale
either
of
these
massive
structures
you
feel
like
you
ve
accomplished
something
because
you
ve
used
everything
climbing
jumping
flying
sliding
to
navigate
them
passive
aggressives
are
often
people
who
believe
their
lives
are
controlled
by
others
but
they
lack
the
skill
knowledge
desire
and
or
confidence
necessary
to
be
assertive
to
minimize
their
attacks
be
as
assertive
as
possible
most
passive
aggressives
find
it
no
fun
to
deal
with
someone
who
will
openly
and
honestly
call
them
out
about
their
behavior
be
aware
that
passive
aggressive
behavior
almost
always
produces
a
passive
aggressive
reaction
the
man
ran
into
the
kredi
bank
in
the
serbian
ski
resort
nova
varos
wearing
a
balaclava
and
brandishing
a
shotgun
and
demanded
tellers
hand
over
all
the
cash
they
had
my
perfect
content
is
the
amber
of
sunset
so
there
you
go
four
easy
to
avoid
pitfalls
that
will
instantly
make
your
game
worse
if
you
fall
into
them
these
are
not
even
technical
things
like
your
mapping
is
not
good
enough
or
your
story
is
not
interesting
these
are
incredibly
easy
to
avoid
mistakes
that
people
simply
should
not
be
making
i
also
called
my
lawyer
and
told
him
what
was
happening
he
advised
me
to
back
off
or
the
insurance
company
might
suspect
me
even
more
i
didn
t
like
what
he
was
telling
me
either
so
i
told
him
to
f
off
and
hung
up
lol
honestly
months
later
we
were
talking
and
i
asked
him
if
he
d
ever
had
a
client
swear
at
him
as
much
as
i
had
and
he
said
no
lol
it
was
strange
talking
over
my
history
the
things
that
happened
5
nearly
6
years
ago
the
living
with
friends
couch
surfing
that
one
night
in
the
park
the
flats
the
refuges
it
seems
like
so
much
of
a
blur
i
honestly
don
t
know
how
i
came
through
that
time
managed
to
escape
the
drug
culture
i
rarely
drink
have
never
smoked
i
ve
never
taken
anything
that
wasn
t
prescribed
i
feel
so
different
from
the
girl
who
used
to
have
screaming
matches
with
her
mother
dodging
hurling
items
while
her
father
sat
idly
by
disturbed
by
what
was
going
on
but
not
disturbed
enough
to
intervene
as
their
actions
are
dragged
out
into
the
daylight
those
who
devised
and
ran
the
uk's
undercover
political
policing
are
letting
kennedy
be
dragged
out
too
cutting
their
ties
to
him
so
they
can
remain
in
the
shadows
a

the

according
to

she
employs
nine
cooks
two
to
cook
the
others
to
watch
over
them
and
two
food
tasters
she
fears
assassination
and
demanded
from
the
central
government
the
highest
level
of
protection
available
in

to
this
outsized
security
apparatus
she
constructed
a
private

to

which
is
cleaned

after

reaches

sending

we

all

to
this

i
m
sure
you
ll
have
your
own
ideas
but
for
me
it
s
simply
about
the
power
of
sharing
something
with
a
bunch
of
other
people
just
look
at
the
faces
of
the
people
taking
part
yes
they
are
professionals
but
the
smiles
look
to
me
to
be
genuine
expressions
of
delight
such
a
strong
and
instinctive
emotion
that
it
carries
itself
to
those
of
us
watching
thousands
of
miles
away
via
the
internet
we
still
choose
to
let
our
children
have
fun
with
the
easter
bunny
and
easter
baskets
we
try
to
do
as
much
of
that
as
we
can
on
saturday
that
way
the
focus
on
sunday
can
stay
on

i
ve
always
been
interested
in
films
from
an
early
age
i
was
in
elstree
youth
theatre
i
started
working
on
film
sets
as
an
extra
and
became
a
runner
i
want
to
create
films
people
want
to
see
partly
for
the
money
but
a
lot
of
it
for
the
creative
side
i
think
i
can
tell
a
good
story
pack
away
phone
and
wallet
open
laptop
and
stare
at
screen
and
i
just
realised
that
i
forgot
to
enter
into
hanna
and
friends
who
want
a
centre
step
sard
it
was
seeing
this
challenge
that
made
me
decide
to
do

duh
and
then
the
song
of
each
member
of
these
states
what
a
pretty
hand
you
have
because
of
all
this
i
left
for
work
exactly
ten
minutes
later
than
usual
in
that
immobility
glow
there
is
no
time
because
time
is
in
the
becoming
in
variations
of
vibrations
different
frequencies
of
vibrations
depict
different
time
and
spaces
there
s
no
question
that
fan
mail
is
fantastic
i
ve
been
touched
and
humbled
by
letters
and
emails
from
readers
amazed
at
their
generous
response
to
my
novel
and
moved
by
the
details
they
ve
shared
about
their
lives
these
letters
remind
me
how
intimate
the
act
of
reading
is
i
m
not
just
talking
about
those
readers
who
ve
taken
my
book
into
bed
with
them
or
read
it
in
the
bath
two
of
my
favorite
places
the
intimacy
i
m
referring
to
is
closer
than
that
the
act
of
reading
allows
the
writer
s
imagination
to
infiltrate
her
reader
s
mind
where
the
story
is
reconstituted
and
absorbed
according
to
that
reader
s
experience
and
understanding
a
good
story

of
course
life
has
bumps
but
i
absolutely
refuse
to
focus
on
them
they
are
irrelevant
i

not

physicist
sean
carroll
who
gamely
tries
and
i
think
succeeds
in
unravelling
the
controversy
in
a
post
at
his
website
cosmic
variance
a
universe
from
nothing
he
thinks
that
albert
and
krauss
are
talking
at
cross
purposes
that
there
are
really
two
sets
of
questions
that
are
fundamentally
different
and
each
physicist
faults
the
other
for
not
considering
his
pet
question
i
ll
post
a
few
excerpts
from
sean
s
piece
which
is
not
easy
reading
but
will
well
repay
your
attention
these
are
not
substitutes
for
reading
his
whole
post
but
will
at
least
outline
the
debate
and
why
it
s
gone
nowhere
i
hope
that
the
weather
is
nice
where
you
are
it
is
finally
getting
sunny
here
in

yay
before
we
get
to
this

inspired
by
the
great

i
may
add
it
is
time
to
announce
last
week's
winners
thanks
to
all
who
participated
when
my
woman
heart
is
in
need
a
look
at
the
development
of
the
doctrine
of
the
trinity
the
relationship
of
the
three
persons
of
father
son
and
holy
spirit
in
one
godhead
shows
how
orthodox
doctrine
was
determined
by
factors
such
as
evidence
from
the
bible
and
the
assumptions
inherent
in
christian
rituals
in
terms
of
evidence
from
scripture
christians
saw
that
the
idea
of
the
trinity
is
found
throughout
the
new
testament
the
new
testament
describes
the
of
israel
whom
jesus
called
father
jesus
who
is
the
word
made
flesh
john
1

and
the
son
who
died
as
a
ransom
for
many
mark
10
45
and
the
spirit
who
is
s
presence
among
believers
after
jesus
ascension
acts
2
in
terms
of
christian
rituals
the
baptismal
formula
also
revealed
the
threefold
character
of
because
the
christian
was
initiated
in
the
name
of
the
father
son
and
the
holy
spirit
matthew

christians
were
understood
to
be
sealed
with
the
spirit
which
was
the
cause
of
holiness

the
church

grabbed
some
black
pants

them

has
recently
been
re
done
to
include
some
awesome
new
features
which
add
to
the
whole
experience
for

there
is
a
soft
add

feature
that
allows
you

friends

heading

my
father
used
to
tell
a
story
that
took
place
when
he
was
probably
in
his
late
thirties
he
was
standing
in
line
at
the
bank
with
my
grandfather
who
turned
to
him
and
said
something
like
have
you
talked
to
mommy
today
insert
the
sound
of
falling
levels
of
testosterone
that
s
why
the
words
of
a
new
song
that
i
recently
found
recently
echo
so
deeply
within
me
a
song
by
indica
titled
in
passing
so
you
can
imagine
my
shock
when
the
clouds
and
rain
rolled
in
on
monday
and
didn
t
leave
until
thursday
of
course
this
is
the
exact
same
timing
i
had
signed
up
the
twins
for
horse
camp
club
hipico
horse
club
is
a
couple
block
walk
away
from
our
casa
and
ever
since
danika
went
to
a
birthday
party
there
last
month
she
has
been
talking
about
horses
horseback
riding
is
quite
popular
here
hmmm
do
you
think
this
might
be
because
my
kids
go
to
a
private
school
now
regardless
it
seems
spanish
and
the
price
was
good
so
i
signed
them
up
although
i
am
a
little
worried
that
this
may
be
the
start
of
an
entirely
new
stream
of
money
outflow
further
it
would
expose
the
state
as
undemocratic
and
controlling
lawful
parties
political
parties
for
their
own
interests
i
am
not
normally
a
big
fan
of
yellow
even
though
it
is
such
a
bright
sunny
colour
but
it
is
a
hot
trendy
colour
right
now
so
we'd
like
you
to
choose
one
colour
to
team
up
with
yellow
i
do
like
the
classic
grey
and
yellow
combo
so
that
is
what
i
chose

a
brutal

not

crazyaxmurderer
what
is
up
did
frabrizio
call
last
month
a
greek
prosecutor
filed
felony
charges
against
a
prominent
banker
over
a
financial
scandal
that
led
to
the
eu
imf
funded
nationalization
of
small
lender
proton
bank
prbr
at
so
the
plan
for
the
rest
of
the
year
is
simple
fix
the
ceiling
and
get
some
books
now
that
i
have
come
clean
about
my
lack
of
progress
perhaps
i
will
also
write
some
more
blog
posts
there
are
recent
discoveries
that
i
want
to
share
begin
b
by
measuring
out
your
oats
i
typically
start
with
either
1
2
cup
then
pour
that
into
your
bowl
or
container
of
choice

nanny
mcphee's
functions
were
mystical
in
nature
while
flow
can
be
explained
by
science
or
can
it
she
said
she
has
heard
it
from
her
father
countless
times
a
chechen
girl
who
loses
her
virginity
before
marriage
is
a
and
allah
will
punish
her
just
by
looking
at
these
shots
i
suddenly
felt
stronger
happier
and
less
broken
i
withdrew
my
work
but
my
favorite
change
so
far
has
to
be
the
dining
room
what
a
transformation
to
those
whose
twisted
thoughts
we
d
rather
label
craziness
there
comes
a
point
when
one
has
had
enough
with
both
sides
of
the
aisle
ok
there
comes
a
point
when
the
centrist
dude
has
had
enough
with
both
sides
of
the
aisle
and
those
not
in
an
aisle
as
well
i
hate
to
ask
personal
questions
in
this
kind
of
context
i
suppose
i
feel
that
i
should
be
going
after
the
answers
myself
but
since
i
had
to
ask
something
when
it
was
time
i
came
up
with
a
health
question
i
ve
always
got
those
i
said
that
although
i
had
been
getting
stronger
and
stronger
with
the
energetic
inputs
i
d
been
getting
from
michael
and
other
sources
in
the
past
few
weeks
i
had
been
sick
a
lot
and
still
didn
t
feel
like
i
was
quite
right
i
asked
whether
i
might
have
picked
up
something
from
a
patient
or
been
energetically
damaged
somehow
in
the
course
of
my
work
the
person
doing
the
reading
had
trouble
getting
anything
and
other
people
tried
to
help
everyone
including
a
reconnective
healing
practitioner
who
was
in
the
class
felt
that
something
was
actually
wrong
but
nobody
could
put
their
finger
on
it
betsy
told
me
that
i
could
ask
again
later
but
i
was
feeling
so
completely
filled
with
good
qi
by
the
entities
around
me
that
it
didn
t
seem
like
an
urgent
question
anymore
and
then
there
are
the
movies
which
are
so
perfect
in
every
way
that
they
feel
like
they
were
made
exactly
for
you
my
best
friend
sophia
that
s
her
real
name
i
love
her
shout
out
and
i
went
to
the
same
high
school
same
college
and
joined
the
same
sorority
we
re
pretty
much
inseparable
or
we
were
til
she
decided
to
go
to
law
school
sophia
was
a
political
science
major
and
i
was
a
chemistry
major
so
she
had
normal
men
in
her
classes
and
i
had
chem
bio
math
majors
in
my
classes
before
you
answer
ariela
held
up
her
left
hand
as
her
right
dangled
by
her
side
knife
at
the
ready
you
should
know
two
things
first
i
ll
remind
you
that
lies
will
result
in
pain
for
your
daughter
and
i
can
tell
when
someone
is
lying
second
i
think
you
and
your
family
were
sent
here
to
probe
our
defenses
and
reconnoiter
our
strengths
and
weaknesses
you
may
be
doing
so
under
duress
perhaps
someone
else
has
threatened
you
or
your
children
and
that
s
why
you
re
doing
it
or
you
may
be
in
league
with
the
other
attackers
i
don
t
really
care
which
i
just
need
to
know
if
i
m
right
or
wrong
anyway
it
was
a
much
nicer
visit
this
time
last
time
when
i
went
with
isaac
and
my
friend
siana
it
was
a
beautiful
sunny
weekend
so
everyone
and
their
mom
was
there
today
it
was
so
quiet
i
loved
it
if
our
presentation
of
christianity
to
those
who
are
not
christians
is
focused
around
what
they
re
doing
wrong
rather
than
the
immensity
of
s
love
for
humanity
we
re
missing
the
point
i
m
officially
taking
my
vote
away
from
obama
you
can
t
run
on
platforms
to
get
elected
then
go
on
television
and
become
the
cool
president
all
the
while
undermining
the
people
who
voted
you
in
sell
it
to
someone
else
i
m
through
listening
become
a
man
of
conviction
you
have
single
handily
proven
why
we
are
imperialists
but
far
more
significant
was
the
president's
trip
to
the
national
council
of
la
raza
in
washington
yesterday
where
the
president
spoke
on
the
need
for
hispanic
empowerment
and
the
need
to
pass
comprehensive
immigration
reform
with
his
position
among
whites
weakening
and
his
standing
in
states
like
north
carolina
and
virginia
and
indiana
very
much
up
for
grabs
the
president
is
going
to
need
to
consolidate
his
hold
in
states
with
large
hispanic
populations
like
florida
colorado
new
mexico
and
nevada
that
he
won
last
time
and
add
other
states
with
hispanic
populations
like
arizona
illinois
and
new
jersey
and
to
be
able
to
get
the
270
electoral
votes
that
he
needs
to
win
the
election
and
bayaz
the
first
of
the
mahi
is
leading
a
party
of
bold
adventurers
on
a
mission
through
the
ruins
of
the
past
the
most
hated
woman
in
the
south
most
feared
man
in
the
north
and
most
selfish
boy
in
the
union
make
strange
companions
but
if
only
they
did
not
hate
each
other
so
much
potentially
deadly
ones
the
269
9
acres
state
land
at
bdc
kuching
is
a
good
example
the
state
could
have
earned
about
rm500
million
from
the
sale
of
the
land
circumstances
conspired
to
stop
me
buying
a
copy
of
the
book
the
uk
cover
is
not
nearly
so
appealing
as
the
one
in
the
post
below
and
the
women
from
the
bookshop
that
were
selling
it
could
not
be
bothered
to
get
their
debit
credit
card
machine
from
the
car
there
is
a
cash
point
just
outside
one
of

you

federal
officials
delisted
wolves
in
the
northern
rockies
based
on
idaho
s
commitment
to
maintain
between
518
and
732
wolves
but
the
governor
broke
this
promise
leading
to
idaho
s
policy
of
killing
off
hundreds
of
wolves
this
gives
new
unfortunate
meaning
to
the
old

switch
my
wife
and
i
went
to
have
an
ultrasound
yesterday
and
found
out
that
we
are
expecting
triplets
we
already
have
a
2
year
old
daughter
and
the
thought
of
adding
3
more
and
doubling
our
family
was
a
bit
overwhelming
not
to
mention
the
fact
that
the
doctor
doing
the
ultrasound
was
incredibly
negative
he
put
on
the
doomsday
cap
and
started
telling
us
everything
that
could
go
wrong
and
that
we
should
consider
a
selective
reduction
around
week

mark
the
two
primary
musical
influences
on
eight
miles
high
were
indian
sitar
player
ravi
shankar
who
taught
george
harrison
how
to
play
that
instrument
and
avant
garde
jazz
saxophonist
john
coltrane
according
to
roger
mcguinn
the
only
recorded
music
that
the
byrds
brought
along
on
the
1965
american
tour
was
a
tape
with
ravi
shankar
ragas
on
one
side
and
two
coltrane
albums
on
the
other

played

signers
of
the
declaration
of
independence
pledged
their
lives
their
fortunes
and
their
sacred
honor
their
honor
they
put
last
in
the
chief
place
that
was
what
counted
and
you
can
feel
it
when
18th
century
men
write
about
their
honor
or
the
horror
of
being
dishonored
it
is
central
to
them
a
mainspring
of
their
thought
and
action
for
something
so
central
to
simply
vanish
from
a
culture
is
astonishing
i
say
men
advisedly
the
concept
of
honor
for
women
was
an
entirely
different
and
lesser
thing
it
had
to
do
mostly
with
fidelity
and
it
is
hard
to
see
it
as
much
more
than
an
instrument
of
subjection
more
about
that
anon
your
first
guess
of
course
would
that
honor
has
not
really
vanished
it
is
just
going
by
another
name
people
do
still
talk
about
integrity
about
being
true
to
yourself
that
sort
of
thing
and
that
certainly
is
half
of
what
18th
century
men
meant
by
honor
it
truly
was
a
wonderful
mother's
day
i
did
not
spend
a
majority
of
it
with
my
kids
but
i
spent
a
good
portion
of
friday
and
most
of
saturday
with
them
when
we
got
home
i
stopped
the
car
in
the
driveway
and
we
listened
to
the
last
couple
minutes
i
laughed
in
delight
when
it
came
to
a
crashing
end
we
have
gathered
up
some
lovely
goody
bags
filled
with
surprises
from
our
sponsors
plus
chances
to
win
a
fabulous
camera
bag
from
ketti
handbags
and

totes
plus

behind

is
headed
to

to
hang
out
with

at

she
is
planning
a

a

pick
out
a
whole
bunch
of
items
to
try
on
i
tried
on
18
pieces
this
year
some
were
fabulous
some
were
okay
some
were
completely
ill
fitting
and
gross
once
i
tried
them
on
you
never
truly
know
what
will
look
good
or
how
something
will
fit
until
it
is
on
your
body
the
line
for
the
fitting
rooms
are
usually
long
so
browse
the
whole
store
and
load
up
so
you
will
only
have
to
wait
in
line
once
promise
the
nation's
second
largest
childcare
provider
bright
horizons
will
work
with
the
partnership
for
a
healthier
america
to
implement
the
checklist
at
nearly
600
child
care
centers
across
the
country
the

coalition

non

was

in

you
are
quite
mysterious
when
it
comes
to
finding
out
more
about
you
i
had
trouble
finding
information
for
my
intro
could
you
tell
us
a
little
more
about
yourself
we
love
to
hear
about
our
interviewees
path
to
success

i
know
the
movie
opens
on
the
the
23rd
but
if
you
are
a
nut
dress
rose
pink
pink
carnation
blossom
then
you
learn
how
to
apply
this
to
living
forms
as
people
move
from
place
to
place
and
perform
actions
their
bodies
limbs
even
their
clothes
and
hair
and
everything
else
are
affected
by
the
forces
exerted
by
the
muscles
working
against
gravity
wind
and
air
resistance
and
this
is
expressed
by
drawing
the
forms
squashed
down
or
stretched
out
also
bodies
can
squash
or
stretch
if
they
are
affected
by
external
forces
out
of
their
control
like
a
person
tripping
and
falling
face
first
on
the
sidewalk
their
face
might
very
well
squash
into
the
hard
pavement
throw
it
in
the
preheated
pan
and
cook
it
for
a
few
minutes
until
lightly
brown
and
dry
looking
on
the
underside
with
some
darker
brown
spots
flip
it
over
and
cook
for
slightly
less
time
until
the
dough
on
the
second
side
is
definitely
dry
with
some
golden
spots
you
can
press
on
any
thicker
spots
at
this
point
to
encourage
them
to
cook
through
remove
to
a
rack
or
cookie
sheet
to
cool
completely
continue
to
do
this
with
all
your
dough
i
know
this
is
just
one
step
to

afraid
of

i
seriously
can
not
take
any
more
reflection
right
now

we
are

i

this

so
i
would
say
there
s
a
much
better
way
and
that
is
allow
the
people
to
make
their
decisions

not
get
the

involved

the

there

used
my

and
the

but
my
powers
were

we
were
able

clear
or
almost
clear
several
more

levels

eventually
we
had
to
retreat
back
to
the
first
underground
level

getting
over
whelmed

forward
to

and
i
am
in

best
shape

life
i
have
run
a
few
half
marathons
i
lift
weights
regularly
and
i
crave
physical
activity
like
never
before
but
then
people
started
to
get
sick
some
people
broke
out
in
horrible
welts
that
covered
their
entire
body
others
always
felt
sick
to
their
stomachs
some
got
dizzy
easily
or
suffered
excruciating
headaches
some
people
even
died
right
after
they
ate
their
dinner
or
right
after
a
healthful
walk
i
was
recently
contacted
by
a

who
lives

inquiring

one

i
simply
glued

then
used

john

here's
to
love
since
barry
appeared
ready
to
hit
the
ski
slopes
he
is
the
image
i
went
with
i
started
by
printing
him
out
onto
su
whisper
white
cs
then
colored
him
in
with
my
copics
after
cutting
him
out
with
my
rectangle
nestabilities
i
added
some
sugar
sparkly
fluff
so
it
would
look
like
barry
was
standing
in
the
snow
mentioning
moleskine
has
reminded
me
that
we
have
some
new
arrivals
in
the
garden
the
new
batch
of
moorhen
chicks
and
a
mole
who
has
started
throwing
up
some
molehills
under
the
shrubbery
molehills
are
good
for
collecting
and
using
to
grow
seedlings
in
far
from
being
irrelevant
our
beliefs
about
the
ultimate
nature
of
reality
frame
our
perspective
on
how
we
can
and
do
act
to
create
sustain
and
change
the
physical
social
and
spiritual
world
of
which
we
are
all
a
part
then
again
the
danger
in
not
having
a
plan
is
that
i
could
end
up
writing
the
same
novel
for
years
and
never
get
to
the
ending
or
worse
the
so
i
do
have
to
be
careful
the
creation
of
a
framework
an
atmosphere
a
structure
is
not
prayer
but
it
is
a
necessary
preliminary
to
prayer
it
is
within
the
atmosphere
of
inner
discipline
and
simplicity
that
prayer
can
begin
to
grow
the
eastern
church
in
its
teaching
on
prayer
focuses
on
the
constant
use
of
the
name
of
jesus
the
first
recorded
teaching
about
the
invocation
of
the
name
of
jesus
comes
in
the
mid
fifth
century
writer
diadochus
he
recommended
the
prayer
lord
jesus
christ
have
mercy
on
me
as
a
way
of
cleansing
the
mind
of
its
sickness
and
he
recommended
this
to
beginners
the
prayer
of
jesus
was
to
be
used
inwardly
and
secretly
at
all
times
when
dropping
off
to
sleep
when
waking
when
eating
or
drinking
while
talking
it
is
seen
as
a
prayer
which
both
binds
the
mind
and
unifies
the
personality
thus
philotheus
of
sinai
in
the
tenth
c
century
says
by
the
memory
of
jesus
christ
gather
together
your
mind
that
is
scattered
abroad
through
the
fall
this
dis
integration
has
happened
but
memory
of
restores
primal
wholeness
the
rule
is
that
you
can
be
any
word
that
has
a
double
letter
in
it
so
you
can
be
a
green
glass
door
you
can
be
an
apple
but
not
a
banana
you
can
wish
just
jennifer
happy
but
you
can
not
wish
her
birthday
it
was
his
turn
to
go
silent
now
the
words
hit
him
hard
and
he
felt
a
part
of
him
go
numb
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
next
his
mind
had
gone
totally
blank
the
main
female
protagonist
in
defy
is
tate
she
s
the
firstborn
daughter
of
skye
and
caleb
from
my
book
foretold
her
character
was
largely
shaped
to
be
the
perfect
complement
to
zachariah
she
also
had
to
be
a
blend
of
her
parents
in
personality
and
appearance
and
based
upon
early
reader
feedback
i
succeeded
in
that
tate
is
adventurous
spontaneous
fun
loving
spirited
good
humored
strong
and
courageous
some
of
those
traits
get
her
into

massaged
my
feet
rotated
my

kneaded
my

and
slightly
slid
my
legs
apart
to

i
felt
a
sensational
warm
wave
go
through
me
my

my
magic
button
swelled
and
my
throbbed
as
the
moisture
continued
to
ooze
from
me
as
he
massaged
the
back
of
my
thighs
i
thought
i
would
die
from
embarrassment
when
i
noticed
he
d
discovered
my
wetness
this
morning
my
dad
was
taking
dylan
to
school
so
jim
and
i
could
tour
a
school
i
made
sure
he
took
the
cookie
cake
and
told
dylan
that
jim
and
i
would
pick
him
up
later
while
we
were
out
i
got
a
call
on
my
cell
but
i
did
not
recognize
the

so
i
did
not
answer

here's

just
a
little
over
midnight
i
was
awakened
with
don
mclean
s
name
dazed
and
confused
i
could
not
recall
who
don
mclean
was
still
wondering
about
the
name
i
involuntarily
sang
the
american
pie
chorus
in
my
mind
thus
i
remembered
i
asked
what
about
him
then
i
panicked
as
a
strong
thought
hit
me
that
america
is
coming
close
to
her
end
talk
of
robber
barons
and
monopolies
is
anti
free
market
rhetoric
cooked
up
by
leftists
who
hate
capitalism

are
in
the
middle
of

an

we
cannot

this

do
not

i

i
can

repaired

afternoon
scouted
out
some
new
parks
riding
the
old
bike
with
the
kiddos
i
adore
headbands
but
i
will
admit
i
was
a
little
leery
of
ordering
one
because
i
could
not
try
it
on
first
and
if
a
headband
is
even
a
smidge
too
tight
i
won
t
wear
it
because
then
i
just
end
up
with
a
giant
headache
but
i
m
happy
to
report
that
this
headband
seems
to
fit
well
and
although
i
have
only
worn
it
once
it
was
for
about
5
hours
and

have
no

prior

it

therefore
i

i

in

i

i
might
be

i

at

japan

so
using

isn

it

you

if

that
all

are

but
you
call
for

of

for

how
can

be
against

but
have
nothing
against
use

that

i
leave
you
with
a
non
potter
quote
i
know
i
know
you
are
disappointed
but
it
is
still
a
good
one
to
ponder
college
is
a
playground
it
s
a
place
to
make
friends
it
s
a
place
to
use
your
imagination
most
importantly
it
s
a
place
to
make
mistakes
getting
bumps
and
bruises
on
the
playground
is
inevitable
but
you
quickly
learn
how
to
recover
is
it
the
same
for
college
relationships
heartache
after
heartache
you
learn
how
to
recover
quickly
brush
it
off
and
continue
to
play
get
played
mistakes
are
mutual
maybe
it
s
a
crush
in
class
a
cute
passerby
on
campus
a
random
hottie
at
a
party
or
even
a
high
school
sweetheart
you
brought
to
college
as
simple
as
those
categories
seem
none
of
them
are
considered
easy
every
situation
is
tempting
but
no
situation
is
promising
the
process
can
be
a
lot
of
hard
work
and
take
a
long
time
there
are
tools
to
help
fsbo
sellers
manage
the
complexity
but
they
do
generally
eat
into
the
profits
from
the
sale
when
a
thick
fog
descends
upon
a
rural
community
and
claims
the
lives
of
anyone
unfortunate
enough
to
be
caught
outside
a
small
band
of
survivors
seeks
refuge
in
a
local
grocery
store
now
i
don
t
normally
like
a
movie
stuck
in
one
place
except
dawn
of
dead
but
this
really
breaks
the
mold
of
normal
horror
films
because
it
s
not
just
moronic
teenagers
with
no
personality
but
this
film
gets
you
feeling
for
the
characters
and
makes
the
impact
of
character
deaths
all
the
more
disturbing
if
you
have
seen
the
end
you
know
what
i
mean
the
monsters
in
this
film
are
hidden
well
behind
the
mist
which
makes
it
more
creepy
and
shocking
when
they
strike
it
s
a
horror
sci
fi
movie
of
real
conviction
it
deserves
to
be
a
hit

and

to
which
zimmerman
responds
he

in
addition
to
the
question
of
how
the
different
types
of
correctness
are
individuated
there
is
the
question
of
how
they
are
related
however
in
order
to
answer
this
we
need
to
explain
one
final
aspect
of
practical
reasoning
which
by
happy
coincidence
is
the
very
same
aspect
required
to
address
the
problem
of
value
this
is
the
fact
that
the
vast
majority
of
practical
reasoning
is
non
monotonic
precisely
what
this
means
is
easier
to
explain
in
relation
to
theoretical
reasoning
most
of
which
is
similarly
non
monotonic
a
non
monotonic
theoretical
inference
is
one
that
does
not
remain
good
regardless
of
what
additional
premises
one
adds
to
it
i
e
an
inference
that
is
defeasible
to
take
brandom
s
example
the
inference
from
i
m
about
to
strike
this
dry
well
made
match
to
it
will
light
is
a
good
one
but
this
ceases
to
be
the
case
if
we
add
the
additional
premise
a
strong
magnetic
field
is
present
this
is
known
as
a
defeasor
there
can
also
be
counter
defeasors
such
as
i
m
standing
in
a
faraday
cage
and
counter
counter
defeasors
such
as
i
m
also
in
a
vacuum
now
instrumental
reasoning
can
be
non
monotonic
in
precisely
the
same
way
as
theoretical
reasoning
because
it
is
governed
by
the
inferential
relations
between
the
corresponding
theoretical
commitments
e
g
all
of
the
defeasors
of
the
above
inference
are
defeasors
of
the
inference
it
is
too
dark
to
see
therefore
i
will
light
a
match
however
it
is
the
non
monoticity
specific
to
motivational
reasoning
that
concerns
us
that
campaign
was
at
its
most
fun
when
the
characters
were
all
hopelessly
incompetent
but
as
they
gained
experience
it
became
a
lot
more
run
of
the
mill
i
do
not
mean
it
was
not
fun
then
too
but
it
was
not
really
much
different
to
any
other
campaign
in
the
beginning
decisions
like
what
farm
equipment
to
take
with
them
really
mattered
they
decided
to
take
the
anvil
for
some
reason
later
on
that
sort
of
stuff
disappeared
ah
well

i
have
to
say
that
this
new
mall
is
incredible
i
had
more
fun
people
watching
than
actually
shopping
all
of
the
pictures
were
taken
on
a
cell
phone
i
e
and
they
blow
i
really
wished
that
i
had
taken
my
bad
boy
camera
but
the
day
was
not
about
me
and
my
hobby
that
decision
will
take
into
account
the
possible
outcome
of
november
s
u
s

election
it
was
fun
that
it
s
taking
me
a
long
time
to
become

i
want
to
be

toos
used
this
site
was
created
by
the
government
to
inform
and
prepare
families
for
emergencies
caused
by
extreme
weather
events
it
is
a
great
resource
in
classrooms
where
there
is
a
threat
of
weather
phenomena
such
as
tornadoes
and
floods
it
does
a
wonderful
job
of
explaining
weather
events
and
talking
about
why
and
how
we
have
to
be
prepared
for
them
complete
with
games
checklists
and
even
teacher
and
parent
materials
it
is
a
great
resource
for
mentally
and
physically
preparing
children
for
extreme
weather
events
and
the
best
book
for
building
your
online
presence
i
am
going
to
acl
this
year
and
i
was
curious
to
see
what
my
mother's
stance
was
on
the
headliners
do
we
still
differ
in
tastes
has
she
meandered
over
into
the
indie
realm
yet
or
is
she
still
stuck
in
1995
surrendering
to
the
darkest
unknown
the
children
didn
t
care
although
a
few
of
the
doctors
were
appalled
the
garden
is
like
a
friendly
oasis
there
s
nothing
really
like
it
hildur
says
and
sigga
and
gabr
ela
agree
we
have
to
remember
that
a
lively
city
centre
isn
t
all
about
fancy
buildings
or
shops
stuffed
with
fashionable
things
we
can
find
that
elsewhere
those
who
travel
to
new
countries
look
for
a
centre
with
a
soul
that
s
what
sirkus
and
everything
surrounding
it
is
all
about
if
we
talk
about
city
planning
people
need
to
think
whether
they
want
to
have
this
kind
of
culture
or
not
and
this
doesn
t
only
apply
to
sirkus
but
to
all
sorts
of
places
facing
demolition
and
reconstruction
gabr
ela
says
begging
for
a
little
more
the
master
gave
him
a
fifth
place
wherever
money
accumulates
in
such
places
there
is
always
cheating
maddening
desire
passion
and
enmity
soft

if
you
get

you

do

gittens
it
s
fun
sometimes
to
be

polarizing

made
this
for

then
a
friend
of
mine
invited
me
to
a
scrapbook
event
called
national
scrapbook
day
i
brought
what
little
supplies
that
i
owned
at
the
time
along
with
photos
of
miss
k
to
work
on
turns
out
that
the
consultant
that
was
hosting
this
event
was
the
mother
of
a
childhood
friend
of
mine
i
was
in
awe
of
the
huge
quantities
of
supplies
she
kept
in
her
home
to
create
scrapbooks
and
keep
soaking
it
in
so
i
have
taken
up
walking
and
zumba
i
feel
much
better
and
spring
is
just
around
the
corner
dani
your
family
is
so
strong
and
i
am
so
proud
of
the
way
they
are
able
to
celebrate
your
life
your
mom
is
truly
one
of
the
most
amazing
people
i
know
and
those
babies
of
yours
are
just
beautiful
your
friends
always
remembering
the
happy
little
dani
that
we
all
know
and
love
your
life
is
truly
something
to
celebrate
and
so
many
people
love
you
dearly
you
touched
so
many
hearts
the
other
day
i
pulled
out
fire
and
hemlock
and
reread
it
for
the
first
time
in
years
and
you
know
what
i
did
when
i
got
to
the
end
i
flipped
it
back
around
and
started
reading
it
again
we
asked
around
a
few
people
on
the
train
if
they
new
the
terminal
for
tower
air
but
no
one
had
ever
even
heard
of
it
we
arrived
at
the
airport
got
some
hearty
good
bye
cheek
kisses
from
our
friend
in
the
orange
jumpsuit
and
exited
the
train
now
i
was
so
worried
about
making
our
flight
and
getting
on
without
tickets
that
my
body
seemed
to
have
forgot
it
was
food
poisoned
1
piper's
as
for
his
list
of
groups
inside
the
book
industry
that
have
been
critical
of
the
decision
they
have
one
thing
in
common
they
all
have
notable
ties
to
the
traditional
industry
and
therefore
stood
to
benefit
from
the
price
fixing
scheme
without
it
genuine
adaptation
is
looking
even
more
necessary
and
that
places
every
group
inextricably
tied
to
the
traditional
model
at
risk
my

i

developed

software
acorn
has
all

i
need
to
edit
my

for
both
print

but
is
unfortunately
only
available
for
the

my
old
version
of

cs2
is
licensed
for
windows
we
are
a
mixed
computer
family
with
both
mac
and
windows
so
i
still
use
both
but
i
use
acorn
more
and
more
instead
of
photoshop
and
all

in

more
recently
a
few
carriers
have
introduced
critical
illness
riders
to
their
policies
this
was
a
major
breakthrough
for
the
industry
life
insurance
policies
that
allow
insureds
to
accelerate
a
discounted
portion
of
the
death
benefit
if
they
suffer
a
critical

such
as
heart
attack
or
the
diagnosis
of
cancer
in

to
other
types
of
critical
illness
as
outlined
in
the
contract
now
life
insurance
policies
can
be
used
during

s
lifetime
to

enormous

of

where
do
you
want
to
spend
your
emotional
and
creative
resources
this
isn
t
a
trick
question
and
there
isn
t
one
right
answer
you
have
to
do
a
cost
benefit
analysis
of
how
maintaining
an
online
presence
fits
into
the
current
stage
of
your
writing
career
if
you
are
getting
up
at
4
30
every
morning
to
write
before
work
then
falling
asleep
at
night
sometimes
before
your
kids
do
then
time
is
probably
your
most
precious
resource
right
now
and
best
not
to
squander
it
better
to
spend
your
time
learning
the
craft
and
pursuing
your
dream
but
if
your
engine
is
set
to
high
idle
and
you
re
just
raring
to
go
by
all
means
dive
in
and
being
putting
some
of
that
energy
to
work
for
you
in
building
a
social
media
presence
you
can
absolutely
have
a
two
pronged
approach
to
establishing
your
career
this
is
a
new
beginning
for
me
this
general
quietness
means
that
a
human
has
to
focus
and
concentrate
and
attend
to
her
in
a
persistent
and
consistent
manner
to
enter
into
much
of
her
world
at
least
that
is
how
nessie
operates
different
rabbits
like
different
dogs
or
different
cats
or
different
humans
have
different
styles
some
are
boisterous
and
wild
some
are
quiet
and
calm
nessie
tends
toward
the
calm
and
quiet
but
she
has
a
major
temper
and
does
not
flinch
at
letting
you
know
when
she
is
displeased
having
a
bunny
give
you
the
squinty
stink
eye
is
sort
of
intimidating
having
a
bunny
rip
out
with
a
full
loud
growl
when
lunging
toward
you
is
startling
and
scary
nope
she
is
not
a
shrinking
violet
just
a
fairly
quiet
one
and
we
are
honored
pretty
much
that
this
quiet
one
graces
us
with
her
presence

the
accidental
apostrophe
the
building
of
a
church
structure
was
delayed
by
the
revolutionary
war
and
it
wasn
t
until
1810
that
the
construction
of
a
church
building
on
the
site
began
the
building
was
completed
in
1820
and
used
until
the
civil
war
because
it
is
for
want
of
a
better
phrase
allowing
the
piper
to
call
the
tune
but
on
we
go
tomorrow
is
another
day
and
in
spite
of
it
all
i
am
looking
forward
to
seeing
what
happens
next
it
a
tough
go
but
nothing
has
defeated
me
yet
so
this
won
t
either
their
is
only
one
man
in
my
whole
crazy
life
that
was
able
to
bring
me

that
was

you

you
paid

for
that
game
you
and
500k
other
people
shelled
out
your

to

the
game
unfortunately
the
game
cost
double
that
to
develop

triple
the
studio
is
forced
to
close
and
your
favorite
ip
is
going

be

you
think
to
yourself
the
game
was
so
good
it
was
amazing
why
didn
t
others
buy
it
then
to
your
shock

dismay
you

alone

if
only

the

would

shuttered
hundreds
would
have
jobs
and
your
favorite
game
would
get
a
sequel
he
finally
did
but
i
was
not
glad
so
i
hid
him
in
the
sandbox
under
a
shoe
off
with
their
heads
i
cried
not
really
but
todd
kept
warning
me

i

jesse
lasky
born
this
day
in
1880
is
best
known
these
days
for
being
one
of
the
founders
of

pictures
you
see
his
name
in
the
titles
of
those
early
silents
famous
players
lasky
but
he
climbed
to
his
exalted
position
allt
he
way
up
the
show
business
ladder
never
skipping
a
rung
beginning
from
his
native
san
francisco
he
started
out
in
medicine
shows
then
became
a
coronet
player
forming
a
vaudeville
act
with
his
sister
blanche
from
here
he
became
an
agent
and
promoter
rice
or
the
memory
i
can
t
say
i
really
have
anything
bad
to
say
about
him
as
a
character
his
role
in
the
plot
was
being
revived
really
i
like
how
how
he
was
revived
was
never
actually
explained
and
being
shu
s
childhood
friend
yeah
that
was
quite
terrible
and
don
t
forget
that
i
never
really
got
his
motivations
for
doing
anything
like
ever
something
something
mana
but
yeah
he
s
your
standard

the

had
stopped

leaving

s
surprised
because
they
haven
t
been
dating
for
long
although
mi
roo
s
hurt
she
s
taking
it
pretty
well
she
suggests
they
go
for
drinks
and
mi
roo
thinks
it
s
a
good
idea
but
gwan
woo
comes
by
asking
if
tan
ya
s
free
at
first
she
s
ready
to
blow
him
off
but
then
he
tells
her
that
famous
photographer
ryan
mcginley
is
having
an
exhibit
in
seoul
she
excitedly
grabs
the
tickets
and
mi
roo
knows
she
s
been
tossed
aside
for
a
good
photography
exhibit
she
tells
tan
ya
to
go
to
the
exhibit
since
they
can
have
drinks
any
time
mi
roo
knows
this
will
be
a
good
way
for
tan
ya
to
open
up
her
heart
a
bit
the
opportunity
occurred
three
weeks
later
mr
digby
had
come
up
to
london
for
one
of
his
monthly
board
meetings
and
had
written
suggesting
that
he
might
call
at
patmore
street
on
friday
evening
first
look
inside
your
own
life
are
you
walking
in
the
integrity
you
expect
from
others
it
s
easy
to
chuckle
at
a
child
s
inability
to
know
that
mickey
mouse
isn
t
real
but
what
about
the
destructive
belief
systems
we
ve
lived
with
so
long
they
ve
taken
on
a
life
of
their
own
frustration
acoompanied
by
immense
nausea
from
exertion
i
am
still
sore
about
it
gah
when
you
sit
through
four
different
panels
with
the
same
work
with
the
agents
rotating
in
and
out
you
really
see
how
much
of
an
issue
of
personal
taste
it
is
your
conflict
feels
constrained
said
one
agent
of
my
query
on
day
1
paraphrased
but
this
was
the
essence
it
feels
like
there
should
be
some
larger
issue
you
are
addressing
this
was
a
broadly
change
your
query
sort
of
suggestion
so
i
nodded
and
took
a
note
deciding
to
wait
until
after
the
conference
to
alter
it
so
i
could
mull
over
possible
changes
what
happened
on
day
2
that
issue
was
not
even
mentioned
by
any
of
the
three
agents
on
the
next
query
panel
what
one
person
sees
in
a
letter
is
not
going
to
be
true
of
others
same
goes
for
pages
the
variation
in
agent
reaction
to
pages
was
truly
remarkable
how
lovely
to
think
of
my
kitchen
full
of
long
braids
of
red
onions
hanging
in
the
corners
i
cannot
wait
to
have
the
storehouse
that
is
our
ex
garage
full
of
winter
squash
potatoes
onions
apples
and
our
chest
freezer
full
of
tiny
sweet
peas
there
is
nothing
like
a
full
storehouse
of
food
and
a
full
shed
of
firewood
to
give
you
a
feeling
of
security
especially
when
petrol
is
now
1
40
per
litre
to
give
my
american
readers
an
idea
of
what
that
would
cost
from
their
generous
gallon
guzzling
pumps
picture
paying
10
15
per
gallon
we
are
trading
our
larger
car
for
a
small
used
diesel
compact
and
converting
it
to
using
biodiesel
at
only
1
06
per
litre
about
7
63
per
gallon
it
will
also
get
much
better
mpg
from
this
small
car
gaining
us
about
20mpg
on
the
old
one
just
in
case
we
are
keeping
the
other
older
car
which
uses
regular
petrol
need
to
cover
our
bases
as
used

hello
baby
so
this
entire
series
was
based
on
the
concept
of
telling
a
story
without
dialogue
or
captions
words
do
still
appear
in
advertisements
within
in
the
comic
websites
tvs
or
things
the
characters
writer
but
these
are
few
and
far
between
in
the
grand
scheme
of
things
ok
so
let
s
get
down
to
it
what
s
troubling
is
that
chairman
mckeon
s
post
gives
you
the
impression
that
it
defends
sec
1021
the
discretionary
detention
provision
when
in
fact
his
post
is
all
about
sec
1022
the
mandatory
provision
the
post
conspicuously
defends
the
provision
without
referencing
a
specific
section
number
and
at
the
end
it
includes
a
chart
titled
section
1021
of
the
fy
2012
national
defense
authorization
act
even
though
one
of
the
two
quotes
in
the
chart
is
from
sec
1022
not
1021
the
only
way
out
of
this
trap
is
to
pursue
what
flanagan
calls
the
rutgers
solution
decide
polly
and
pip
will
go
to
a
regional
or
state
university
set
goals
accordingly
and
let
any
other
extra
stuff
come
from
their
interest
and
their
discretion
while
this
doesn
t
actually
sound
that
bad
it
essentially
precludes
the
potential
of
either
of
them
making
the
leap
into
greatness
into
the
realm
of
the
global
elite
and
that
potential
however
small
is
difficult
for
me
the
product
of
upwardly
mobile
parents
and
weaned
on
the
idea
that
anyone
can
become
president
to
let
go
of
we
the
parents
together
with
his
teachers
past
present
and
future
all
work
together
to
put
that
foundation
together
and
continue
to
help
construct
his
building
quite
a
big
responsibility
for
all
of
us
but
i
would
not
have
you
to
be
ignorant
brethren
concerning
them
which
are
asleep
that
ye
sorrow
not
even
as
others
which
have
no
hope
for
if
we
believe
that
jesus
died
and
rose
again
even
so
them
also
which
sleep
in
jesus
will
bring
with
him
for
this
we
say
unto
you
by
the
word
of
the
lord
that
we
which
are
alive
and
remain
unto
the
coming
of
the
lord
shall
not
prevent
them
which
are
asleep
for
the
lord
himself
shall
descend
from
heaven
with
a
shout
with
the
voice
of
the
archangel
and
with
the
trump
of
and
the
dead
in
christ
shall
rise
first
then
we
which
are
alive
and
remain
shall
be
caught
up
together
with
them
in
the
clouds
to
meet
the
lord
in
the
air
and
so
shall
we
ever
be
with
the
lord
wherefore
comfort
one
another
with
these
words
last
week
turned
out
to
be
way
more
expensive
than
i
planned
though
most
of
my
money
went
on
this
food
stuff
that
i
ve
heard
so
much
about
a
45
shop
at
m
s
would
have
cost
me
about
100
had
i
paid
full
price
so
i
consider
that
money
well
spend
including
these
pretty
awesome
vegetable
kebabs
with
halloumi
cheese
whilst
we
could
make
our
own
for
cheaper
and
will
it
was
at
least
a
nice
imagination
starter
and
both
thursday
and
friday
saw
breaks
in
the
rain
in
the
afternoon
so
i
was
able
to
get
in
some
decent
walking
12
miles
on
friday
it
looks
like
from
the
outside
that
they
are
not
used
to
strong
women
who
took
the
urging
of
pope
pius
xii
very
seriously
pope
pius
xii
urged
women
religious
way
before
i
was
in
the
community
to
be
educated
in
theology
to
get
educated
in
advanced
degrees
there
are
several
different
types
of
flea
market
vendors
there
are
guys
selling
items
directly
from
estate
sales
as
well
as
one
time
vendors
who
bring
the
items
that
did
not
sell
in
their
garage
sales
there
are
collectors
looking
for
a
quick
buck
by
selling
parts
of
their
collections
off
along
with
people
selling
new
items
that
look
almost
new
each
market
will
be
different
depending
on
your
area
but
they
are
all
about
selling
things
cheap
prices
are
almost
always
negotiable
be
prepared
to
encounter
many
fun
colorful
characters

prestigious
brand

and

your
eyes
only
the
walk
ended
up
being
a
lot
longer
than
usual
and
it
took
me
about
70
minutes
to
get
back
yikes
i
was
10
minutes
late
from
lunch
oh
well
i
miss
lunch
a
lot
so
i
deserve
it
by
the
time
i
got
back
i
was
so
thirsty
i
ended
up
drinking
about
32
oz
of
water
then
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
i
spent
making
trips
to
the
sheesh
then
they
begin
to
hope
it
can
be
done
it
is
envisaged
that
this
will
be
completed
during
june
this
year
at
which
stage
the
minister
steve
tshwete
will
review
his
decision
as
well
as
the

the
best

to

plants
is
to
do
it
during

while
it
differs
by
plants
in
general
plants
need
about
an
inch
of

each

during
hotter

this
will
probably
work
out
to
about
three
times

joe
asked
beeradvocate
describes
it
as
an
old
ale
and
i
think
that
is
right
old
ale
is
a
comforting
balm
to
cold
weather
sporting
burnished
mellow
notes
they
are
not
aggressive
or
flashy
but
rather
evoke
that
sense
of
agreeable
mustiness
this
stormy
weather
has
been
putting
me
in
a
wintry
mood
and
the
old
vintage
ale
was
the
perfect
beer
to
address
it
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
is
brilliant
that
you
ll
come
with
me
we
decided
to
celebrate
afterwards
by
going
to
the
famous
betty's
tea
shop
i
went
to
the
one
in
york
years
ago
and
remembered
its
atmosphere
of
elegant
indulgence
i
even
remember
what
i
ate
a
unusual
confection
of
cream
pastry
black
cherry
and
cinnamon
things
have
changed
a
little

seems

yep
that
is
all
above
all
malaysians
must
never
bow
down
to
a
government
and
prime
minister
so
callous
they
can
feel
no
compunction
in
sacrificing
the
safety
and
well
being
of
their
citizens
just
to
cling
to
power
i
am
still
under
the
weather
and
on
top
of
that
i
am
getting
ready
for
both
a
writer's
conference
and
my
daughter's
birthday
the
one
happening
the
day
after
i
get
back
from
the
other
which
is
a
long
winded
way
of
letting
you
know
that
this
is
going
to
be
a
rerun
of
an
old
post
but
it
is
a
post
i
need
to
revisit
for
myself
because
the
writing
or
the
lack
of
it
is
getting
to
me
i
can
not
get
to
the
computer
for
more
than
a
few
minutes
at
a
time
and
in
those
minutes
i
wonder
if
i
am
spending
my
time
productively
in
the
last
few
days
of
class
before
my
break
began
we
were
let
out
ridiculously
early
leaving
me
with
plenty
of
time
to
bust
out

and
read

i
miss
you
i
remember
with
fondness
my
teenage
years
when
i
could
sleep
well
past
10am
i
was
the
child
who
had
to
be
woken
up
most
christmas
mornings
because
i
knew
deep
down
that
the
presents
would
still
be
there
at
9am
much
to
the
chagrine
of
my
brother
and
parents
move
into
my
college
days
allnighters
studying
late
night
talks
with
the
roomies
and
what
were
my
favorite
post
midnight
memories
john
and
i
would
spend
half
the
night
on
the
phone
i
went
to
union
and
we
had
these
things
called
curfews
so
after
curfew
we
would
end
our
nights
out
 
on
the
phone
 
these
phones
were
attached
to
cords
yes
pre
cellphone
conversations
we
would
talk
about
life
future
our
pasts
there
was
nothing
that
was
off
limits
i
could
still
find
you
sleep
an
afternoon
nap
after
classes
sleeping
late
on
saturday
mornings
we
were
still
very
good
friends
back
then
ethics
class
however
taught
me
something
useful
about
myself
i
push
myself
too
hard
i
really
do
of
course
my
nieces
telling
me
that
is
being
a
good
teacher
for
me
too
i
need
to
stop
breathe
and
realize
i
ve
been
through
worse
times
i
can
survive
this
too
school
is
not
proving
to
be
as
hard
as
i
thought
and
i
m
up
for
the
challenge
what
i
am
no
longer
up
for
is
being
responsible
for
the
lives
of
those
too
sick
or
fragile
to
care
of
themselves
i
just
can
t
do
it
i
can
t
even
pretend
that
would
be
unethical
i
have
a
small
chuckle
to
myself
we
ve
been
discussing
ethical
behavior
since
day
two
of
class

hi
i
m
paige
from
final
clothes
out
and
a
big
thanks
to
janine
for
inviting
me
to
post
here
today
my
blog
is
all
about
being
smart
when
you
shop
and
part
of
that
is
knowing
when
not
to
spend
which
satan
delivers
a
child
a
death
curse
carefully
cut
the
candy
into
small
pieces
it
is
much
easier
to
cut
successfully
when
cold
actually
let
me
correct
myself
by
saying
that
you
should
score
it
into
which
serving
sizes
you
want
when
cold
and
then
after
it
has
sat
out
for
a
bit
and
softened
then
cut
it
use
a
very
sharp
knife
how
they
accomplished
this
is
not
a
guarded
secret
their
attitude
towards
the
preservation
of
their
cultural
heritage
is
among
the
most
dedicated
i
ve
ever
seen
when
tarpaulins
and
banners
are
banned
in
the
town
plaza
they
re
dead
serious
when
it
comes
to
heritage
conservation
you
know
what
a
good
rattling
of
the
old
body
and
brain
is
always
a
good
thing
right
the
program
today
parlays
nicely
with
what
we
did
yesterday
although
if
you
did
not
heed
our
warning
about
mid
line
stability
today
is
going
to
be
and
will
expose
a
lot
of
weaknesses
you
need
to
address

a
lifetime
of
public
service
if
the
democrats
don
t
exploit
that
they
re
dumb
now
you
ve
got
someone
that
people
can
believe
when
he
talks
about
real
americans
and
fiscal
worries
no
riding
today
the
weather's
dreary
and
i
think
i
am
coming
down
with
something
we
continued
our
photo
mission
the
extreme
exploitation
of
labour
alongside
the
duty
free
plants
of
japan
taiwan
us
etc
in
the
special
economic
zones
and
clever
adoption
of
new
technology
which
is
now
being
invested
in
the
classic
manner
of
the
european
and
american
imperialists
before
it
in
asia
africa
and
latin
america
to
plunder
the
resources
of
the
colonial
and
semi
colonial
and
of
course
rival
eu
australian
and
us
imperialist
economies
to
extract
viii
for
the
ale
drinker
now
a
world
of
only
dark
beers
would
seem
like
a
paradise
but
much
of
the
brewing
was
very
inconsistent
the
flavors
and
aroma
not
being
regulated
by
strict
yeast
strains
yielding
varying
degrees
of
success
lagering
changed
all
that
and
combined
with
the
science
brewers
were
able
to
make
to
new
clearer
beers
the
technology
employed
to
create
such
creations
was
applied
to
all
styles
of
beer
benefiting
the
old
and
the
new
truth
to
be
told
ales
progressively
fell
out
of
favor
as
they
represented
the
old
world
and
lagers
came
to
dominate
the
markets
probably
associated
with
the
progressive
spirit
in
which
they
were
born
ales
have
made
a
come
back
but
lagers
still
dominate
the
beer
landscape
so
rather
than
ignore
them
the
student
of
beer
will
become
familiar
with
them
with
everything
going
on
this
week
the
death
of
venerable
character
actor
anthony
williams
on
feb
15
kind
of
slipped
under
the
radar
had
it
not
been
for
the
post
on
the
page
of
fb
friend
actor
erik
todd
dellums
i
probably
would
have
missed
it
entirely
eating
all
the
chocolate
because
let
s
be
honest
the
best
part
of
vd
isn
t
twuuu
wuvv
it
s
the
chocolate
but
four
years
is
an
eternity
in
athletics
and
during
his
exile
from
the
sport
sprinting
changed
those
who
were
in
his
wake
during
his
reign
of
success
tyson
asafa
powell
and
usain
bolt
have
all
improved
dramatically
has
since
won
his
own
sprint

at
the
world

and
dropped
his

and
is
the
current
ar

in
the

72
pulled
off
nice
and
smooth
and
never
looked
back
de
molen
bring
it
on
we
ve
also
heard
a
couple
of
people
ask
whether
the
nest
box
might
fill
with
water
the
answer
is
no
the
tray
has
drainage
holes
under
the
gravel
which
allows
the
rainwater
to
drain
into
the
gulley
when
the
falcons
first
chose
the
building
as
their
home
the
nest
area
was
often
waterlogged
so
we
fitted
a
nest
box
that
was
slightly
raised
off
the
guttering
floor
to
allow
the
water
to
pass
underneath
my
turn
the
fine
bureaucrat
tells
me
to
read
one
of
the
lines
from
chart
b
easy
peasy
then
she
asks
me
to
cover
my
right
eye
and
read
the
sign
uh
oh
as
with
everything
in
my
life
right
now
nothing
is
balanced
not
even
my
eyeballs
my
left
eye
is
farsighted
that
is
good
reading
chart
b
is
easy
now
cover
your
left
eye
where
the
did
the
chart
go
you
would
think
i
would
remember
the
letters
since
i
just
read
them
for
the
nice
lady
no
no
you
would
be
soooo
wrong
i
struggle
guess
hem
and
haw
finally
she
has
me
look
into
a
machine
what
the
frig
when
does
the
dastardly
dmv
turn
into
optometrists
she
asks
me
over
and
over
if
i
can
read
the
lines
just
give
me
my
license
she
asks
me
if
i
wear
glasses
to
drive
nope
i
have
never
needed
them
because
you
see
i
drive
with
both
eyes
open
call
me
crazy
so
you
can
well
imagine
that
i
have
a
lot
to
share
fi
is
writing
a
blogpost
for
her
not
new
more
restored
blog
and
would
love
some
visitors
so

i

d
i
am
off
to
melt
into
an
inner

on

river
my
muscles
deserve
some
relaxation
and
how
else
can
i
get
rid
of
my
spando
bike
short
tan
i
was
looking
for
a
photograph
that
meant
something
more
than
re
visiting
the
past
when
len
prince
sent
me
this
picture
it
is
an
iphone
snap
of
a
contact
sheet
that
he
had
never
tried
to
print
or
publish
but
ten
years
later
the
picture
makes
a
lot
of
sense
in
this
place
a
relic
place
it
tracking
tristano's
time
signatures
and
deciphering
a
pair
of
matt
otto's
original
compositions
taxed
my
atrophied
brain
concentrating
on
a
crosscurrent
performance
is
akin
to
winding
one's
way
through
a
meditation
maze
at
the
conclusion
of
wednesday's
labyrinth
like
concert
i
was
almost
too
exhausted
to
check
my
cellphone
to
get
the
latest
update
on
kim
kardashian
like
the
gold
being
refined
until
you
can
see
your
reflection
in
it
uses
the
trials
in
our
life
as
a
way
to
refine
us
until
we
reflect
him
this
process
will
take
a
lifetime
literally
and
the
only
way
it
can
be
achieved
is
if
we
continue
to
obey
him
despite
the
trials
life
throws
at
us
in
time
slowly
but
surely
we
will
begin
to
resemble
and
that
was
the
end
of
the
crib
why
is
it
that
people
think
you
have
to
be
just
like
them
in
order
to
be
of
any
value
i
don
t
get
it
i
read
an
article
about
chik
fil
a
today
that
hit
a
nerve
in
precisely
the
right
way
to
make
me
blow
my
lid
and
resulted
in
a
facebook
status
that
reflected
my
lost
temper
the
gist
of
the
article
was
the
restaurant
s
support
of
anti
organizations
if
you
listen
to
or
watch
or
read
any
source
that
ever
once
mentioned
that
right
wing
rhetoric
or
conservative
anger
or
any
such
thing
contributed
to
the
tucson
arizona
shooting
you
are
tuning
in
to
a
demonstrated
source
of
propaganda
and
lies
anyway
i
made
a
layout
of
me
last
saturday
after
a
while
i
felt
my
skill
has
become
rusty
without
further
ado
here
is
the
layout
i
promise
2012
is
going
to
be
my
artsy
craftsy
year
our
time
together
ended
as
mr
fawkes
got
a
phone
call
that
calls
him
away
on
urgent
business
but
that
i
suspected
was
prearranged
to
ensure
he
could
make
a
polite
exit
what
is
rustic

dang
we
re
good
sometimes
it
just
takes
two
heads
to
figure
it
all
out
i
am
thrilled
to
have
emily
a
clark
as
a
guest
blogger
today
she
has
a
wonderful
sense
of
style
and
has
created
the
most
beautiful
playful
little
girl's
bedroom
i
am
so
glad
she
agreed
to
give
you
a
tour
today
thanks
emily
i
was
not
looking
for
something
that
was
more
he
then
took
both
of
his
hands
and
spread
my
lower
lips
apart
bent
down
and
stuck
his
long
hard
tongue
deep
into
my
wetness
moving
in
and
out
tonguing
me
until
i
filled
his
mouth
curry
leaves
are
mostly
consumed
in
south
asia
and
you
can
see
that
effect
of
it
many
people
will
have
long
lenghty
hairs
yes
its
good
for
hair
logistics
and
professionalism
even
finally
being
smart
is
a
necessary
threat
women
must
capitalize
their
worth
beyond
their
curves
my
little
sister
thinks
she
wants
to
be
a
nurse
although
her
grades
in
science
may
not
be
the
best
teachers
should
take
her
under
their
wings
to
make
sure
she
doesn
t
lose
her
steam
they
should
provide
her
with
the
tools
and
help
she
may
need
to
stay
true
to
her
dream
especially
as
a
young
lady
that
navigates
the
world
as
a
dark
skinned
beauty
our
mom
always
says
that
as
young
black
women
we
need
the
promise
of
intelligence
on
our
inner
resumes
apologies
again
for
the
naff
piccies
but
i
am
still
using
my
mums
old
camera
till
i
buy
a
new
one
after
mine
died
the
image
i
printed
onto
elegance
satin
cardstock
so
i
could
colour
it
in
with
my
promarkers
i
added
a
little
sakura
clear
glaze
pen
over
the
strawberries
in
the
basket
which
made
them
pop
the
red
gingham
papers
are
off
the
cd
rom
and
the
large
heart
doilies
i
bought
from
poundland
these
were
really
good
value
but
are
only
good
on
8x8
cards
due
to
their
size
the
sentiment
i
did
on
the
computer
i
think
the
font
is
clear
typewriter
which
is

if
you
have
yet

yourself
myspace
currently
offers

if
you
check

on
sunday
there
should
be
a
playgirl

waiting
for

and
that
s
the
set
up
the
common
wisdom
is
that
it
was
developed
so
that
chief
minister
abdul
taib
mahmud
could
use
it
as
an
excuse
to
log
the

my
friends

i
all
saw
the

thing
two
people
carrying
a
dead
monkey
out
of
a
temple
dedicated
to
shiva
as
part
of
a
procession
including
other
dead
animals
and
animal
parts
during
a

dedicated

if
anyone
would
like
to
explain
this
to
me
you
know
where
to
find
me
the
president
is
a

a
kenyan
that
s
a
fact
thank
you
everyone
who
hosted
me
and
took
me
places
and
shared
your
lives
and
towns
and
made
the
adventure
so
big
and
memorable
thanks
to
those
who
read
the
blog
and
cheered
me
on
in
my
quest
to
document
best
idea
ever
this
time
however
i
decided
to
be
brave
this
map
business
i
m
will
fly
by
the
seat
of
my
pants
yeah
we
then
see
det
trupo
at
his
house
in
the
morning
answering
his
doorbell
he
opens
the
door
to
find
a
live
turkey
in
a
cage
outside
his
door
he
then
sees
his
prized
sports
car
blow
up
frank
has
an
elaborate
thanksgiving
dinner
at
his
mother's
house
with
the
whole
family
attending
we
also
see
some
scenes
of
junkies
overdosing
after
dinner
frank's
family
gathers
outside
he
asks
his
nephew
steve
who
he
had
arranged
a
tryout
with
the
yankees
why
he
had
not
tried
out
steve
tells
him
he
does
not
want
to
play
ball
anymore
as
he'd
rather
be
like
frank
frank
is
called
away
by
huey
who
tells
him
there
is
a
problem
frank
and
huey
visit
nikki
barnes
at
his
nightclub
frank
tells
him
to
stop
cutting
his
blue
magic
and
if
he
has
to
to
call
it
something
else
as
the
name
stands
for
his
quality
of
product
and
weakens
his
brand
name
nikki
gets
insulted
by
frank's
demanding
tone
but
agrees
following
this
pain
clinic
fiasco
i
m
then
off
to
physical
therapy
where
i
m
not
quite
sure
i
m
getting
much
help
but
it
is
required
as
part
of
operation
hand
get
better
right
now
i
m
wadding
up
a
paper
towel
with
all
fingers
except
my
index
finger
yes
i
know
this
sounds
silly
and
easy
but
it
is
actually
difficult
and
quite
painful
a
few
more
exercises
per
day
and
i
m
not
sure
my
wrist
would
function

cranking

evert
30

the

brulee
s
eyes
narrowed
and
i
said
the
draenei
never
wished
to
take
up
the
sword
in
the
light
s
name
to
increase
my
combat
prowness
to
on
the
field
of
battle
war
was
upon
me
and
my
people
i
wanted
us
to
live
and
therefore
i
learned
still
one
did
not
and
just
as
well
as
those
who
did
have
a
dip
eventually
in
the
river
that
is
made
once
the
waterfall
water
levels
off
further
down
in
the
valley
found
it
painfully
cold
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
release
the
photos
from
that
swimming
attempt
but
trust
so
here
is
my
lesson
and
how
we
solve
word
problems
i
blew
it
and
i
knew
it
let
go
jump
in
oh
well
whatcha
waiting
for
it
is
all
right
 
cause
there
is
beauty
in
the
breakdown
it
s
hard
to
say
came
the
nurse
s
reply
he
s
just
had
an
infusion
of
morphine
so
he
may
be
simply
out
of
it
at
the
moment
but
i
think
at
some
level
he
will
register
your
presence
take
his
hand
talk
to
him
quietly
people
sense
things
at
all
sorts
of
levels
among
gleaming
leaves
i
think
i
ll
leave
it
there
for
now
but
before
i
do
i
would
just
like
to
say
a
big
big
thank
you

single

a
mother
but
is
a
feminist
she
believes
that
all
women
have
the
right
to
determine
what
they
want
out
of
life
and
go
for
it
when
caitlin
got
married
she
did
not
think
it
was
going
to
be
the
best
day
of
her
life
she
wanted
something
low
key
her
and
her

her

could
treat
it

a
laugh

a
shy
person

you

changes
in
her
throughout
the

and
i
m
sure
that
more
will
come
in
the
next
books
many
characters
that
we
know
from
the
previous

are
in
this
series

even
yelena

a
brief
appearance
i
love
long
weekends
i
am
getting
much
better

to
why

hello

i

i
used
a
clip
from
them
at
the
beginning
of
the
first
song
good

my
mom
is
asking
me
to
sing

i

saying

the

rocket
launch
was
a
failure
they
re
not
prepared
in
fact
our
ndrrmc
is
more
prepared
than
north
korea
does
it
make
sense
why
the
bible
the
animal
part
of
us
wants
to
get
in
the
car
to
drive
two
blocks
to
the
neighbor
s
house
or
better
yet
to
pick
up
the
telephone
instead
of
walking
because
it
is
responding
to
evolutionary
pressure
to
conserve
energy
evolutionary
pressure
that
is
responding
to
conditions
that
no
longer
exist
since
there
is
effectively
zero
chance
of
you
having
to
run
away
from
a
predator
before
dinner
or
to
chase
after
a
rare
opportunity
to
catch
wild
game
however
your
body
is
relying
on
two
million
years
of
genetic
memory
that
you
will
be
exercising
your
human
capacities
for
endurance
soon
only
you
won
t
what
your
elephant
wanted
and
probably
got
was
a
short
ride
in
a
nice
air
conditioned
car
what
your
elephant
needed
was
some
good
cardiovascular
exercise
and
how
about
that
commute
to
work
here
are
two
interesting
facts
from
contemporary
psychology
a
person
does
not
adapt
to
long
and
stressful
commutes
even
after
years
of
experience
there
are
measurable
cognitive
impairments
a
person
does
adapt
to
smaller
living
environments
after
just
two
months
of
living
in
a
significantly
smaller
space
a
person
s
average
happiness
returns
to
the
same
level
as
when
living
in
a
larger
space
we
build
suburbs
because
we
don
t
know
understand
and
accept
who
we
are
as

we

pub
rock
the
english
roots
rock
movement
of
the
early
 
70s
would
never
have
earned
a
cult
following
if
it
was
not
for
brinsley
schwarz
initially
brinsley
schwarz
was
a
rambling
neo
psychedelic
folk
rock
band
that
borrowed
heavily
from
crosby
stills
nash
and
the
grateful
dead
following
a
disastrous
publicity
stunt
to
promote
its
debut
album
the
band
went
into
seclusion
outside
of
london
and
developed
a
laid
back
rootsy
sound
inspired
by
eggs
over
easy
an
american
band
that
had
been
playing
a
mixture
of
originals
and
covers
in
english
pubs
following
their
conversion
to
pub
rock
the
brinsleys
ditched
their
pretensions
of
stardom
and
became
a
down
to
earth
self
effacing
rock
roll
band
between
1971
and
1974
brinsley
schwarz
toured
england
innumerable
times
playing
pubs
across
the
country
along
the
way
they
established
a
circuit
for
similar
bands
like
dr
feelgood
and
ducks
deluxe
to
follow
though
the
group
was
nominally
guitarist
brinsley
schwarz's
band
bassist
lead
vocalist
nick
lowe
provided
the
bulk
of
the
group's
songs
lowe
developed
a
distinctive
songwriting
voice
conversational
melodic
offbeat
and
funny
and
the
band
was
infused
with
his
skewed
sense
of
humor
despite
strong
reviews
and
a
dedicated
fan
base
the
brinsleys
never
managed
to
escape
cult
status
yet
they
influenced
a
legion
of
other
artists
creating
an
underground
back
to
basics
movement
that
laid
the
foundation
for
punk
rock
three

this
week
was
inspired
by
a
wonderful

that
clare

called

clare
writes
about
3
beautiful

that
happen
each

it
is
a
wonderful

i
can
only
hope
to
imitate

does
the
audience
know
about
your
subject
what
is
their
attitude
the
basic
steps
are
pretty
simple
you
say
that
a
small

market
does
not
exist
in

head
to
virginia
avenue
park
saturday
mornings
and
pick
up
a
loaf
of
wonderful
hazelnut
cranberry
bread
as
well
as
your
basic
necessities
i
am
also
a
fan
of
this
market
because
while
gloria's
stand
sells
quality
produce
for
half
the
price
there
is
also
a
stand
run
by
asian
american
farmers
so
i
can
pick
up
the

of

we
find
her
overcoming
the
natural
tension
of
performing
by
dealing
with
what
is
really
going
on
in
the
moment
without
artifice
and
thereby
turning
the
tables
on
a
bad
situation
booked
for
a
show
with

where
she
met
life
long
friend
brice
she
was
so
bad
in

that
dismissal
seemed
imminent
however
she
managed
to
bring
down
the
house
on
her
opening
line
henry
by
shouting
it
so
loud
that
it
rattled
the
roofbeams
for

she
got
a
similar
reaction

unbuttoned

coleman
ran
a
west

offense
with
plenty
of
play
action
fakes
and
quick
throws
and
has
experience
both
under
center
as
well
as
in
shotgun
although
he
has
some
experience
going
through
his
reads
and
progressions
he
will
certainly
need
more
work
here
at
the
next
level
as
he
had
a
number
of
pre
determined
reads
or
throws
that
were
planned
before
the
snap
and
will
tend
to
stare
down
some
of
his
targets
in
addition
when
in
shotgun
the
coaches
called
plenty
of
catch
and
throw
passes
which
didn
t
do
much
to
help
his
development
b
j
s
footwork
is
where
i
d
like
to
see
it
as
he
has
a
feel
for
sinking
his
hips
into
his
back
leg
before
stepping
forward
and
driving
through
his
front
leg
in
his
throwing
delivery
however
i
would
like
to
see
him
exaggerate
the
sinking
of
his
hips
more
to
get
more
momentum
and
torque
going
into
his
throws
in
his
mechanics
he
offers
a
quick
delivery
however
he
throws
the
ball
too
mechanically
and
i
d
like
to
see
him
develop
a
more
natural
and
fluid
throwing
motion
with
his
position

coleman
has

mobility
at

to
move
about

must
develop
a
better
feel
for
where
the

rush
is
coming
from
he
s
a
pure
pocket
passer
who
is
very
comfortable
dropping
back
and
reading
the
field
however
he
s
not
far
enough
along
yet
in
his
ability
to
sense
the
rush
and
escape
when
he
does
manage
to
get
outside
the
pocket
he
has
what
it
takes
to
get
the
job
done
on
bootlegs
and
he
s
proven
that
he
can
throw
the
ball
accurately
on
the
run
in
addition
when
given
an
opportunity
to
take
off
with
the
ball
down
the
field

has
a
heady
understanding
of
when
to
tuck
the

down

about

for

caring

you

you

can

our

has
been
confirmed
by

as
well
as

as

how

koreans
are
about

in

to

most
koreans
would

associate

it
also
helps

since
the
end

turkey
and
korea
have
maintained

crucial

a

this
is
in
contrast
to
the

which
undoubtedly
did
a

of
things
to
annoy
koreans
partially
because
it
has
been
a
little
too
close
eating
away
at
the
good

it
earned

having

the

over

so
recently

subject

as
you

be

i
have
just
watched
a

on
the
new
trends
among
some
teenage
circles
have
i
aged
that
much
and
am
i
just
another
old
retrograde
fool
or
has
society
lost
its
mind
and
heading
back
to
dark
ages
i
sure
don
t
want
to
sound
like
a
bird
of
ill
omen
i
am
no
puritan
and
i
think
i
am
rather
tolerant
but
when
some
young
people
get
this
sick
idea
that
fun
is
to
get
soaked
and
until
they
drop
i
feel
like
something
in
this
world
is
beyond
my
grasp
i
do
not
believe
this
issue
is
as
cut
and
dry
as
people
make
it
out
to
be
people
are
put
in
either
the
florescent
rainbow
camp
or
the
brainwashed
h8tr
camp
and
i
have
never
felt
like
i
belong
to
either
after
much
thinking
and
discussing
and
several
totally
awesome
friends
even
in
utah
i
know
i
have
come
to
two
main
conclusions
the
story
was
absolutely
enthralling
for
me
i
could
not
put
this
book
down
when
i
had
to
my
mind
was
preoccupied
with
it
while
i
cooked
dinner
worked
did
basically
anything
else
susan
weaves
history
into
the
story
sometimes
with
too
much
instruction
but
still
in
a
well
researched
and
comfortable
way
on
my
walking
route
there
is
one
of
those
dogs
that
i
worry
about
what
happens
when
he
finally
comes
through
the
fence
the
owners
have
lost
a
previous
dog
that
was
killed
when
he
came
out
and
chased
one
too
many
vehicles
and
caught
the
truck
yet
they
don
t
come
out
and
work
with
their
new
dog
when
he
comes
running
out
hackles
up
when
anything
car
truck
or
person
walks
down
the
road
when
they
first
got
the
new
dog
they
came
out
on
stood
on
the
back
step
and
yelled
across
the
yard
at
the
dog
the
dog
did
not
listen
and
they
have
long
since
given
up
and
no
longer
come
out
to
holler
at
their
dog
it
was
too
much
trouble
and
he
wasn
t
leaving
their
yard
so
they
gave
up
now
the
dog
has
discovered
how
to
get
out
of
the
yard
and
into
their
pasture
what
keeps
this
dog
from
me
when
walking
is
now
only
a
few
strands
of
barbed
wire
he
is
still
in
their
yard
but
just
barely
they
see
nothing
wrong
with
this
because
he
is
still
in
their
yard
and
yes
they
are
technically
correct
on
the
other
hand
they
are
one
step
away
from
another
disaster
and
they
could
prevent
it
by
being
a
responsible
dog
owner
ozzy
osbourne
band
the
final
step
in
the
process
is
applying
the
protectant
this
is
a
little
runnier
than
the
paint
and
goes
on
clear
but
provides
the
long
lasting
protection
for
the
cabinets
it
takes
a
full
7
days
to
cure
completely

karen

is
another

whom
i
have
followed
since
my

blogging
days
and
will
provide
some
food
for

when
you

the

leaped
backwards
again
and
skidded
over
to
one
of
the
panels
in
the
console
time
of
course
is
a
different
matter
if
i
could
i
would
tell
them
it
mattered
all
of
it
every
lyric
every
guitar
riff
every
bass
line
every
drum
beat
every
period
of
time
they
decided
to
take
space
every
moment
they
stopped
singing
and
lifted
a
crowd
so
high
that
we
sang
it
for
you
they
held
up
a
mirror
of
emotions
and
experiences
and
we
answered
with
a
 
me
too
 
i
used
my
very
under
used
martha
stewart
deep
border
punch
and
inked
all
the
edges
in
old
paper
distress
ink
the
stamp
i
stamped
directly
onto
the
lighter
gingham
paper
and
layered
them
up
i
had
a
little
of
the
darker
yellow
paper
left
so
i
stamped
the
centre
of
the
daffodil
only
onto
the
scraps
i
had
left
this
saved
me
doing
any
colouring
whatsoever
which
is
good
as
i
am
quite
a
slow
colourer
the

so
i
will
tell
you
what
you
are
looking
at
that
is
a

the

paul
well
she
s
been
my
wife
for
54
years
and
we
re
going
to
have
an
anniversary
on
february
1st
at
this
time
of
year
we
are
grateful
for
our
families
and
also
organizations
like
fnps
which
works
every
day
through
grassroots
volunteer
members
to
preserve
conserve
and
restore
the
native
plants
and
native
plant
communities
of
florida
as
i
said
in
my
letter
my
childhood
experiences
led
me
to
being
part
of
fnps
because
i
believed
in
the
mission
before
i
even
knew
there
was
an
fnps
for
once
the
weather's
going
my
way
when
we
arrived
at
11
15am
everyone
had
been
waiting
around
for
45
minutes
for
police
or
mainroads
or
someone
to
come
and
block
the
road
off
unfortunately
police
didn
t
arrive
until
11
30am
and
cars
had
been
driving
through
the
mess
for
quite
a
while
we
got
some
fantastic
interviews
from
two
extremely
angry
people
whose
cars
had
around
1
2
inches
of
tar
gravel
attached
to
their
tires
i
don
t
blame
them
for
being
so
furious
considering
how
hard
a
time
the
workmen
were
having
getting
it
off
the
tires
another
woman
who
didn
t
want
to
go
on
camera
was
on
work
time
and
her
2
year
old
car
had
scratches
down
the
side
of
it
from
where
the
road
had
pulled
up
and
scratched
it
month
3
of
chemo
was
awful
but
jerry
and
mary
visited
from
ny
and
we
went
to
see
bruce
in

also
modeled
in

the
bcrc
art
bra

show
robert
shows
on
tuesday
mornings
backing
his
little
van
into
my
driveway
throws
open
the
back
door
and
pulls
out
his
kit
a
mower
some
weeks
a
blower
others
always
a
rake
and
a
trimmer
he
unlocks
the
gate
and
goes
about
his
work
and
within
an
hour
or
so
he
is
gone
all
that
i
need
to
do
is
have
handy
the
garden
waste
bin
oh
and
an
espresso
i
have
him
hooked
on
this
once
a
week
caffeine
rush
i
have
been
growing
more
keenly
aware
of
where
my
food
comes
from
and
what
it
is
actually
made
out
of
the
last
couple
of
years
i
grew
up
eating
fast
food
my
parents
both
worked
at
a
fast
food
company
for
25
years
it
was
just
what
you
ate
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
you
should
eat
any
differently
i
did
not
spend
much
time
in
the
produce
aisle
until
i
was
18
and
interested
in
dropping
some
weight
i'd
put
on
while
on
the
pill
switching
to
fruits
vegetables
and
protein
meant
dropping
60
lbs
in
about
6
8
months
it
felt
almost
effortless
i
decided
to
make
a
square
dance
quilt
for
her
birthday
3
fold
the
mixture
until
they
combine
well
this
coat
is
one
of
the
things
i
managed
to
snag
in
the
boxing
day
sales
it
is
from
river
island
which
is
somewhere
i
never
used
to
shop
but
recently
i
have
been
going
in
there
more
and
more
i
have
not
had
a
proper
winter
coat
in
ages
and
ages
so
i
was
not
sure
about
getting
this
in
case
it
was
a
bit
too
granny

in

but
it
is
really
warm

was
obvious
and
didn
t
even
have
the
gall
to
pass
on
the
results
to

have
long
wondered
whether
what
sells
is
as
random
as
the
spin

perhaps
there
is
a
general
trend
that

hudson
was
bought
out
by
a
third
party
leading
to
a
slight
change
in
strategy
in
particular
hudson
then
sought
to
produce
products
of
essentially
the
same
design
as
those
previously
put
forward
but
this
time
without
pockets
although
these
were
supposed
to
be
marketed
as
off
field
clothing
it
was
quite
possible
that
they
might
end
up
being
sold
to
football
teams
and
used
as
team
kit
thus
potentially
infringing
dick's
exclusive
licence
for
on
field
wear
however
hudson
took
the
commercial
view
that
its
business
and
dick's
business
were
sufficiently
different
that
dick's
would
not
be
harmed
by
such
a
move
this
was
authorized
by
miss
jackson
but
as
before
no
formal
written
approval
was
given
shortly
after
this
event

behold
the
days
are
coming
says
the
lord
when
i
will
make
a
new
covenant
with
the
house
of
israel
and
with
the
house
of
judah
not
according
to
the
covenant
that
i
made
with
their
fathers
in
the
day
that
i
took
them
by
the
hand
to
lead
them
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
my
covenant
which
they
broke
though
i
was
a
husband
to
them
says
the
lord
but
this
is
the
covenant
that
i
will
make
with
the
house
of
israel
after
those
days
says
the
lord
i
will
put
my
law
in
their
minds
and
write
it
on
their
hearts
and
i
will
be
their
and
they
shall
be
my
people
no
more
shall
every
man
teach
his
neighbor
and
every
man
his

saying
know
the

for
they
all
shall
know
me
from

of

an
american
the
ever
serenading
singer
bruno
mars
had
a
tremendous
success
in
such
a
small
span
of
time
this
american
singer
songwriter
and
producer
had
vocalized
top
songs
like
just
the
way
you
are
nothin
on
you
and
the
lazy
song
just
to
name
a
few
but
in
partnership
to
a
singer
s
success
is
of
course
fashion
and
this
man
this
amazing
man
made
it
to
the
cut
to
be
the
very
first
person
to
be
featured
on
on
the
spotlight
first
pick
a
corner
of
the
room
you
want
to
have
the
fort
in
you
will
have
to
first
break
the
cardboard
boxes
so
they
are
flat
let
your
children
decorate
them
any
way
they
want
once
decorated
put
two
holes
at
the
top
of
the
cardboard
and
thread
your
string
ribbon
now
attatch
ribbon
to
the
ceiling
so
the
cardboard
is
hanging
make
the
ribbon
long
enough
so
the
cardboard
almost
touches
the
ground
now
you
have
a
fort
that
doesn
t
take
up
any
room
because
it
is
hanging
from
the
ceiling

well
folks
we
re
onto
another
of
our
garam
masalas
i
hope
you
ve
enjoyed
making
some
or
all
or
none
of
these
masalas
this
week
as
i
said
in
my
vegan
blog
last
week
is
my
poultry
masala
well
as
so
much
of
my
food
is
woven
into
my
life
here
s
another
little
tale
me
what
why
would
you
do
that
that
can
make
them
very
sick
places
to
start
reading
high
fantasy
i
tried
to
find
the
answer
in
mishneh
torah
but
the
only
thing
i
could
find
was
what
he
writes
about
the
various
books
we
have
an
election
coming
up
here
in
brenham
it
is
for
the
city
of
brenham
and
the
only
ad
i
ve
seen
for
it
has
been
in
the
classified
section
of
our
newspaper
maybe
it
s
elsewhere
but
i
ve
not
seen
it
i
have
seen
very
few
things
in
the
paper
about
any
debate
or
q
a
session
among
the
candidates
so
i
m
wondering
how
the
voters
will
make
an
informed
decision
do
they
go
on
name
recognition
alone
one
name
i
recognize
would
be
one
i
wouldn
t
vote
for
i
don
t
live
in
the
city
limits
so
i
won
t
be
able
to
vote
in
this
election
but
members
of
our
group
do
i
think
they
should
be
allowed
the
opportunity
to
question
those
running
are
they
running
to
fulfill
an
agenda
or
to
help
the
community
why
do
they
think
their
way
is
the
way
stossel
said
he
left
because
it
there
he
went
on
to
describe
a
working
condition
where
abc
tolerated
him
for
years
and
held
their
noses
but
by
the
end
stossel
said
he
was
looking
for
the
closest
door
but
here's
the
thing
of
the
blogs
that
i
skipped
over
because
their
a
to
z
posts
were
short
frivolous
things
like
a
is
for
apple
because
i
really
came
across
that
one
more
than
once
how
many
of
them
actually
have
blogs
worth
following
but
were
lying
during
the
a
to
z
month
because
the
short
posts
attract
more
flies
i
will
never
know

just

not

going

i
know
i
have
blogged
before
about
shakespeare
as
when
i
was

we
were
taught
that
no
one
knows
if
shakespeare
was
a
single
writer
a
group
of
writers
or
a
traveling

of
writing
performers
they
open

this
looks
like
a

stop

i
intended
to
be
much

i

i
often

the

really
don

take

you

last

zach
was
drawing

asked
me
if
yasminah
had
feet
this
may
sound
like
an
odd
question
to
most
however
we
only
had
a
few
photos
of
yasminah
and
none
of
them
included
her
feet
regardless
of
what
others
would
say
or
think
after

the

you

from

and
olive
groves
that
you
did
not
plant
the
bible
indicates
many
occasions
where
olive
trees
are
linked
to
the
provision
of
the
books
of
deuteronomy
and
joel
both
speak
of
the
lord
s
unmerited
abundance
including
olive

in
other
words
olive

were

hog
production
provided
an
inexpensive
means
of
converting
waste
food
crop
waste
and
garbage
into
calories
in
a
relatively
small
space
and
in
a
relatively
short
period
of
time
many
of
those
calories
came
in
the
form
of
fat
and
rendered
lard
lard
was
used
for
almost
all
cooking
and
was
a
fundamental
component
in
many
common
homestead
foods
many
that
today
are
still
regarded
as
holiday
and
comfort
foods
like
biscuits
and
pies
the
economic
caloric
necessity
of
consuming
lard
and
other
saved
fats
may
have
led

the
popularity
of

10

in

and
the

here
are
some
of
my
faves
from
here
i
retraced
my
steps
back
to
the
campsite
to
retrieve
my
pack
and
then
headed
back
to
cane

in
order
to
jump
back
on

this

from

with

is
1
8
miles
long
and
gains
about
500
feet
in
elevation
the
uphill
is
pretty
steady
with
just
a
few
flat
areas
to
give
your
lungs
a
rest
it
is
rarely
very
steep
but
it
gave
me
a
workout
it
was
here
that
i
saw
the
only
other
trail
users
of
my
whole
trip
3
trail
runners
coming
down
the
trail
as
i
was
heading
up
the
trail
is
pretty
rocky
and
fairly
eroded
and
rutted
in
many
places
and
climbs
up
a
dry
sandy
ridge
that
offers
some
nice
views
to
the
west
looking
back
toward

at
about
2000
feet

the

starting
to
take

the

turning

the

and
the
hickories

bright
yellow
after
i
was
finished
with
my
stamping
i
decided
that
my
card
still
needed
some
color
and
so
i
added
a
bit
of
sponging
along
the
bottom
ground
i
first
began
lightly
sponging
using
chocolate
chip
ink
ever
so
lightly
and
then
i
went
upward

think
this
is
where
one
has
to
modify
the
concept
for
their
own
needs
and
what
they
feel
comfortable
with
doing
no
spoilers
here
but
as
the
story
unfolds
there
comes
a
point
when
palmer
tells

a

about
his
life
time
in

and
what
he
is
witnessed

i
still

i

this

because

what
because

they

the
trouble
with
this
parable
is
in
the
assumption
that
we
know
who
jesus
is
speaking
to
those
who
were
confident
in
their
own
righteousness
and
the
assigning
of
roles
this
is
exactly
what
we
must
not
do
with
this
parable
it
s
too
easy
to
do
so
it
s
too
easy
to
know
exactly
who
is
the
publican
and
who
is
the
sinner
and
the
minute
we
start
assigning
roles
we
have
ceased
being
a
player
either
a
publican
or
a
tax
collector
and
started
being
the
one
who
justifies
one
and
not
the
other
i
e
it
is
only
who
justifies
and
therefore
only
who
can

roles

my

back

yay
after
all
the
food
on
new

day
january
2nd
should
hold
a
morning
of
detox
dropped
by
old
world
brewery
after
work
yesterday
and
managed
to
keep
to
my
one
beer
promise
and
get
back
to
beer
rant
hq
before
sundown
which
is
nice
i
didn
t
try
the
anniversary
ale
though
i
d
planned
to
originally
i
just
can
t
keep
away
from
that
dark
knight
porter
of
theirs
and
dang
if
i
ain
t
glad
i
did
this
time
i
travelled
to
millicent
440
kms
from
adelaide
on
friday
around
lunch
time
my
friend
kerri
turned
40
on
monday
and
at
her
husbands
suggestion
we
threw
a
surprise
birthday
party
for
her
turns
out
kerri
does
not
deal
too
well
with
people
 
forgetting
 
a
milestone
birthday
and
apparently
was
a
bit
sulky
to
see
that
people
were
a
bit
 
cold
 
and
detached
prior
to
the
party
i
thought
you'd
forgotten
about
me
she
said
of
course
we
were
all
bursting
inside
but
none
of
us
could
let
on
she
burst
into
tears
when
she
saw
a
heap
of
us
adelaide
people
there
and
everything
was
just
perfect
kerri's
mum
hosted
the
party
and
i
was
in
awe
at
the
design
of
her
house
the
pic
above
is
one
lounge
room
there
are
three
1
you
can
write
long
sentences
as
long
as
you
begin
them
with
the
subject
and
verb
the
weird
part
is
she
is
totally
staging
the
house
for
christmas
all
sorts
of
expensive
decorations
going
up
in
every
room
some
new
some
existing
in
the
mean
time
she
let
the
yard
go
to
and
the
new
pool
pump
burn
out
and
go
to
i
have
sat
back
and
watched
it
happen
now
here
is
the
thing
even
though
she
is
me
i
would
have
totally
helped
her
in
hopes
she
would
list
it
and
find
a
decent
buyer
one
that
wants
an
existing
renter
since
i
have
no
guarantees
and
she
is
chosen
to
ignore
me
i
have
chosen
not
to
assist
in
kind
now
call
me
crazy
but
what
is
the
point
of
spending
all
the
time
money
and
effort
to
decorate
a
home
all
christmas
style
and
not
even
have
it
listed
yet
does
she
think
she
is
going
to
attract
a
ton
of
holiday
buyers
in
this
economy
now
i
do
not
know
a
lot
about
real
estate
but
i
think
it
would
be
common
sense
to
have
it
already
on
the
market
if
you
are
planning
on
having
christmas
events
centered
around
listing
and
selling
your
home
just
a
few
updates
ok
now
for
the
story
of
when
we
found
out
i
had
taken
a
first
response
early
result
on
july
16th
nothing
popped
up
after
the
time
limit
except
the
test
line
or
so
i
thought
through
examining
it
a
bit
more
if
i
held
it
to
the
light
i
could
kinda
see
another
pink
line
but
i
did
not
get
my
hopes
up
i
figured
i
will
just
test
again
on
sunday
the
18th
the
day
before
af
was
due
well
sunday
morning
i
woke
up
and
went
to
the
bathroom
all
prepared
for
another
negative
and
to
my
dismay
the
first
little
pink
line
came
up
in
less
than
a
minute
it
was
faint
at
first
but
at
the
end
of
3
minutes
it
was
a
definite
positive
kidz
city
has
other
activities
coming
up
very
soon
it
seems
like
the
organizing
with
diy
fest
has
been
going
really
well
and
the
kids
program
looks
amazing
call
me
a
snob
but
that
s
a
bit
naive
to
think
that
you
could
get
a
job
with
the
experience
of
answering
phones
a
ten
year
old
could
do
that
when
you
re
eighteen
a
job
isn
t
fluffy
and
gentle
like
a
fabric
softener
commercial
it
s
gritty
sour
physically
demanding
mentally
straining
emotionally
damaging
and
the
pay
off
is
a
three
hundred
dollar
check
for
two
weeks
of
work
minus
taxes
benefits
what
the
heck
are
those
a
first
job
should
make
you
want
to
run
for
the
college
gates
because
you
don
t
want
to
spend
the
rest
of
your
life
serving
slushies
to
bratty
children
or
stocking
shelves
i
was
probably
the
first
person
to
sit
him
down
and
put
him
in
his
place
i
said
you
ve
cribbed
your
time
cards
he
said
i
m
worth
it
i
said
i
don
t
care
how
good
you
are
it
s
just
dishonest
and
there
s
a
lot
to
be
said
about
the
current
attitude
the
club
is
radiating
so
far
they
ve
had
the
benefit
of
having
a
team
ahead
of
us
to
chase
down
but
now
they
re
ahead
in
the
race
for
third
and
all
alone
they
need
to
maintain
this
intensity
be
ready
to
overcome
the
bad
luck
injustice
and
doubts
that
could
lie
in
wait
over
the
next
nine
matches
daragh
your
navigating
duties
wind
and
currents
analysis
were
outstanding
you
kept
us
in
the
current
flow
and
maximum
vmg
to
the
mark
now
if
those
helmsmen
would
not
be
chasing
lifts
and
headers
and
with
all
that
in
mind
i
couldn
t
be
sure
that
she
deserved
this
they
will
hear
me
call
911
and
there
is
no
way
a
dispatcher
will
get
anyone
here
in
time
to
help
me
calling
for
help
is
useless
it
would
only
take
them
a
few
minutes
to
attack
there
is
not
time
to
explain
to
a
dispatcher
or
to
anyone
where
i
am
exactly
there
is
nowhere
to
run
they
have
me
surrounded
but
for
the
water
behind
me
they
cannot
be
up
to
any
good
they
have
spread
out
like
a
line
of
soldiers
and
they
all
have
sinister
faces
evil
they
are
frowning
why
are
they
frowning
at
me
evil
evil
is
here
i
am
done
what
will
happen
to
jamoka
will
he
rip
them
to
shreds
there
are
too
many
oh
a
rope
what
is
in
that
guy
s
pocket
am
i
dreaming
this
is
not
happening
denial
will
do
me
no
good
will
they
let
me
by
maybe
it
s
not
a
rope
they
don
t
even
need
a
rope
no
no
no
i
can
t
risk
getting
close
enough
to
find
out
and
i
can
t
turn
around
i
have
to
go
through
them
i
have
to
get
out
to
hesitate
is
to
show
fear
fear
would
appeal
to
their
worst
characteristics
they
will
be
excited
by
my
fear
when
i
did
the
huge
rewrite
on
commences
a
number
of
plot
changes
inevitably
occurred
that
affected
the
next
three
novels
in
the
quintet
since
i
m
now
working
on
the
second
of
these
novels
i
thought
i
d
better
check
my
old
notes
to
see
what
if
anything
needs
to
be
changed
in
transference
so
far
i
can
t
find
anything
a
character
from
the
fourth
novel
who
appears
in
a
different
unrecognisable
form
in
commences
also
appears
briefly
in
transference
so
changes
regarding
this
character
need
to
be
found
failing
so
far
can
t
find
my
notes
for
the

what

the

is
actually
a

off

he

that

of

he

this

finally
the
lionization
of
clark
since
his
death
has
fascinated
me
in
that
while
the
guy
was
indeed
a
part
of
all
of
our
childhoods
he
wasn

a
particularly
warm
media
personality
oh
sure
his
top
40
dj
voice
was
mellow
and
very
pleasant
to
listen
to
and
he
had
the
cleancut
good
looks
of
any
era
s
boy
next
door
but
clark
was
a
host
and
nothing
more
like
ryan
seacrest
today
he
was
an
anodyne
presence
who
had
no

persona
to

by
the
time
i
leave
i
m
ready
to
take
a
long
nap
but
alas
i
have
arranged
to
meet
my
colleague
vicki
for
lunch
at
a
mall
near
the
opera
house
we
meet
for
a
nice
lunch
of
sushi
and
then
i
head
to
muscat
city
center
for
some
shopping
i
have
three
things
on
my
list
today
a
pair
of
sunglasses
a
black
handbag
and
a
dress
appropriate
to
wear
to
the
opera
house
next
time
i
go
i
come
away
with
2
out
of
the
3
items
on
my
list
i
m
left
empty
handed
on
the
dress
there
are
girls
already
permanently
encamped
in
our
dorm's
basement
they
have
staked
their
claim
on
their
particular
piece
of
table
and
set
up
a
permanent
residence
leaving
their
coffee
mugs
books
computers
planners
and
schedules
strewn
about
like
so
much
detritus
of
war
and
it
all
started
with
a
missed
flight
in
fort
lauderdale
some
may
say
that
it
was
a
coincidence
that
i
missed
that
flight
and
everything
else
happened
but
i
will
tell
you
that
my
soul
says
i
would
be
married
today
if
i
didn
t
miss
that
flight
i
might
not
have
been
married
forever
this
all
had
to
come
out
sometime
but
the
timing
was
perfect
our
ability
to
come
together
to
stop
or
limit
damage
to
the
world
s
environment
will
be
perhaps
the
greatest
test
of
how
far
we
can
act
as
a
world
community
no
one
should
under
estimate
the
imagination
that
will
be
required
nor
the
scientific
effort
nor
the
unprecedented
co
operation
we
shall
have
to
show
we
shall

know
just
the
sort
of
stuff
that
s
needed

optimistic
stuff
straight
from
the
shoulder
this
shoulder

tapping
why
i
was
so
nervous
this
morning
i
can
t
imagine
for
anything
simpler
than
distributing
a
few
footling

to
a
bunch
of
grimy

kids
i
can
t
imagine
still
for
some
reason
i
can

imagine
i
was
feeling
a
little
nervous
but
now
i
feel
fine

fine
fine
fine
and
i
say
this
to
you
as
an
old

because
that
s
what
you
are

when
all
the
smoke
has
cleared
away
an
old

i
don

think
i
ve
ever
met
an
older
friend
how
long
have
you
been
an
old
friend
of

there
are
many
theories
of
how
machu
picchu
was
used
by
the
inca
empire
but
several
are
more
accepted
than
others
some
believe
it
was
an
estate
of
the
inca
emperor
pachacuti
who
may
have
overseen
most
of
the
construction
of
the
site
many
of
the
human
bones
recovered
from
the
site
are
female
leading
some
to
believe
machu
picchu
was
some
sort
of
monastery
for
chosen
women
based
on
the
number
of
trails
leading
to
and
from
machu
picchu
some
now
believe
it
could
have
been
a
center
of
commerce
as
well
as
a
political
religious
and
social
center
whatever
its
function
it
is
an
impressive
site
and
an
incredible
example
of
the
blending
of
architecture
into
natural
surroundings

i
have
had
a
long
few
days
yes
i
indulged
in
a
hamburger
and
a
beer
but
after
a
40
mile

ride
i
felt
entitled
i
can
do
that
and
maintain
my
weight
it
would
be
nice
to
think
i
can
lose
weight
that
way
but
let
s
be
real
so
when
filmmaker
jay
michael
visited
the
area
40
miles
ne
of
oklahoma
to
shoot
some
background
footage
and
investigate
the
story
he
found
that
local
residents
knew
all
about
the
swamp
monster
tale
along
with
the
fake
shoe
and
phony

new

west

we
had
planned
on
cheese
and
biscuits
followed
by
coffee
liqueurs
and
mints
but
as
it
was
1am
before
we
hit
the
puds
they
fell
by
the
wayside
all
of
us
had
wee
ones
to
deal
with
in
the
morning
so
the
2
30am
bedtime
we
eventually
succumbed
to
was
pushing
all
our
boundaries
ah
if
you
can
not
push
it
on

when
can
you
eating
your
way
to
midnight
is
a
sure
sign
that
you
have
passed

it
not
but
you
know
what
i
like
this

flush

to
slip
into
a
more
relaxed
state
as
the
night
sped
past
moves
in
for
again
i
am
not
suggesting
that
anyone
who
contacts
me
is
obligated
to
hire
me
far
from
it
all
i
am
suggesting
is
that
once
someone
has
opened
up
a
dialogue
with
me
we
should
have
an
actual
dialogue
in
fact
it
is
that
dialogue
that
helps
them
and
me
determine
if
we
are

good

lady

always
transforming
herself
and
staying
fresh
in
the
spotlight
lady
gaga
has
shone
as
bright
as
every
this
past
year
yes
she
does
weird
things
and
dresses
like
a
transvestite
but
gaga
still
remains
a
positive
role
model
in
the
celebrity
world
she
is
an
avid
activist
who
believes
in
fighting
for
your
rights
and
is
an
icon
for
and
across
the
world
one
particular
pr
move
that
made
people
love
and
appreciate
her
even
more
was
this
past
fall
when
a
14
year
old
boy
from
buffalo
new
york
jamey
rodemeyer
committed
suicide
due
to
peers
bullying
him
for
being
lady
gaga
was
his
number
one
role
model
and
when
he
took
his
life
she
took
matters
into
her
own
hands
gaga
spoke
at
the
iheartradio
festival
saying
that
bullying
must
become
illegal
it
is
a
hate
crime
she
also
tweeted
about
it
and
created
a
lot
of
buzz
each
of
us
has
our
own
unique
flaw
but
it
is
the
cracks
and
flaws
we
each
have
that
make
our
lives
together
so
very
interesting
and
rewarding
now
we
can
make
our
bundle
of
balloons
start
with
a
heart
balloon
by
making
a
regular
heart
then
adding
a
little
tail
next
to
that
balloon
draw
a
yellow
round
balloon
and
add
a
tail
add
a
couple
more
heart
balloons
to
finish
out
the
bundle
outline
each
balloon
and
add
a
smile
to
the
yellow
balloon
doodle
a
bow
to
hold
the
balloons
and
draw
strings
down
from
the
balloons
to
the
bow
that
had
to
be
molluscs
have
an
outer
layer
of
tissue
or
skin
called
mantle
in
many
species
the
mantle
secretes
calcium
carbonate
caco3
to
produce
the
hard
outer
shell
like
the
ones
we
tend
to
imagine
when
any
minute
particle
such
as
a
grain
of
sand
or
even
a
tiny
fish
gets
lodged
in
the
mantle
it
secretes
a
special
substance
known
as
nacre
to
encapsulate
the
irritant
and
protect
itself
meanwhile
in

party

went
on

a

the

t
pay

in
a
country
with
one
of
europe
s
biggest
economic
disparities
government
workers
are
being
demonized
as
the
biggest
problem
in
greece
but
it
is
precisely
government
workers
who
can
t
evade
paying
taxes
their
employer
makes
sure
of
that
k
is
a
name
for
the
wife
of
the
five
p
avas
yes
all
five
brothers
had
a
single
wife
it
s
a
long
story
she
is
so
named
because
of
her
intense
love
for
k
a
and
is
more
commonly
known
by
the
name
draupad
so
we
ve
examined
our
maps
and
satellite
photos
and
decided
what
our
ao
is
going
to
be
this
is
a
satellite
view
of
the
area
i
used
to
live
in
take
a
look
at
it
and
then
reference
the
legend
below
it
to
see
what
we
came
up
with
introduction
i
have
been
friends
online
with
a
woman
from
australia
on
and
off
again
due
to
various
circumstances
in
our
lives
since
2002
she
is
one
of
my
very
best
friends
and
she
probably
knows
me
better
on
a
more
deeply
personal
level
than
almost
all
of
my
real
life
friends
do
avoid
being
with
colleagues
and
try
and
include
someone
who
knew
the
layout
of
the
building
so
if
you
really
wanted
to
do
a
good
job
on
a
book
of
all
365
of
these
designs
you'd
need
to
copy
and
paste
all
the
content
download
all
the
photos
re
stitch
and
re
shoot
all
the
photos
that
look
bad
edit
the
content
down
format
it
for
a
book
and
whew
then
you'd
be
ready
to
publish

historically

currently

that
recreate
historic
time

they
have
been
made

brass

done

this

why
 
individual
magi
then
embark
on
a
course
of
study
wherein
their
specific
talents
are
identified
and
enhanced
some
magi
find
they
have
some
limited
ability
over
the

can
move
objects
from

can

were

an
urge
to
touch

feel
its

somehow
can

thinking
this
would
show
a

for

of

commemorate

also
for
the

involved

my

son
and
i
went
strawberry
picking
yesterday
i
did
not
even
know
there
was
such
a
farm
where
we
live
but
after
doing
some
research
there
was
one
only
about
30
minutes
away
i
was
ecstatic
especially
since
strawberries
are
my
favorite

anything
i
also
found
this

recently
that
has
compiled
a
set
of

pictures
of
all
the
animals
discussed
in
the
burgess

i
think
we
will
get
them
printed
and
create
a

go
along
with

most
of
the

were

at

with
a
mix
of
regular
and
seasonal
beers
i
was
along
on

with
my

as
well
as
to

my

thought
all
parents
were
pretty

the
same
as
mine
i
had
no
real
idea
of
the
luxury
i
was
afforded
by
having
two
well
educated
left
wing
cultured
parents
not
just
in
financial
terms
were
we
lucky
it
was
also
the
intellectual
luxury
the
enjoyment
of
debate
and
discussion
of
having
a
house
full
of
their
bohemian
friends
the
glamour
of
parties
at
home
and
seeing
mum
dressed
up
in
her
finery
to
go
out

wish
i
d
kept

choose
me
at
this
point
i
m
just
blaming
day
care
you
had
to
write
ideas
character
sketches
and
dialogue
in
it
we
were
told
to
listen
to
people
s
conversations
and
write
down
the
bits
we
liked
the
whole
class
became
eavesdroppers
we
could
be
found
sitting
too
close
to
groups
of
people
while
we
scribbled
feverishly
into
our
notebooks
the
worst
saddest
part
was
not
only
how
he
left
this
earth
but
what
his
life
had
come
to
in
the
end
he
died
on
the
bar
room
floor
from
alcohol
poisoning
he
was
forty
two
his
last
ten
or
so
years
he
had
become
a
liqour
sploshed
brain
the
town
he
had
a
schedule
at
each
bar
from
ten
or
eleven
am
until
close
he
showed
the
bar
tenders
the
bent
worn
pictures
of
us
from
his
wallet
they
didn
t
believe
we
were
really
his
he
bragged
about
us
i
know
this
because
when
i
was
eighteen
or
nineteen
when
i
was
an
alcohol
and
speed
freak
myself
in
another
city
i
decided
to
find
him
to
question
him
and
i
didn
t
know
for
sure
why
but
when
i
finally
found
him
at
tim
sandy
s
i
couldn
t
resist
his
slim
hovering
body
alone
at
the
bar
in
his
old
packer
jacket
he
wore
the
same
brown
framed
glassed
that
only
magnified
his
beautiful
eyes
in
a
seventies
fashion
i
pulled
up
a
stool
next
to
him
and
said
hi
dad
now
the
junta
is
offering
a
national
convention
with
mali
s
entire
political
class
to
discuss
the
country
s
future
in
a
move
that
signals
it
may
be
more
concerned
with
looking
back
than
looking
forward
it
has
also
proposed
putting
the
deposed
president
amadou
toumani
tour
on
trial
for
high
treason
this
is
significant
because
it
effectively
forestalls
any
attempt
to
return
the
country
to
its
pre
coup
legal
framework
which
would
restore
tour
however
symbolically
or
temporarily
to
power
the
dust
that
i
breathed
that
day
gave
me
a
severe
allergy
to
last
a
few
days
but
i
did
save
thousand
rupees
plus
on
the
taxi
wise
or
penny
wise
after
being
mis
directed
by
some
untrustworthy
folks
on
the
walk
back
and
having
a
bad
time
of
it
i
almost
cancelled
the
rest
of
the
trip
and
came
home
but
then
i
knew
that
if
i
did
not
finish
this
trip
as
planned
i
might
never
go
again
so
steeling
my
nerves
i
went
forth
to
pipariya
and
pachmarhi
where
i
had
the
most
wonderful
time
of
my
life
love
and
power
one
of
lenin's
rhetorical
attacks
upon
social
democrat
and
trade
union
leaders
and
officials
was
to
dismiss
them
sneeringly
as
labour
lieutenants
of
capital
seeking
a
role
as
subordinate
partners
in
managing
the
exploitation
of
our
class
that
cannot
be
said
of
the
general
council's
invitation
to
david
cameron
looks
as
though
they
are
landscaping
the
park
and
putting
in
a
new
walk
path
i
kind
of
like
the
little
tattoos
people
put
in
discrete
places
i
ve
even
considered
doing
it
myself
a
little
butterfly
here
or
there
okay
maybe
if
i
was
younger
i
would
ve
done
it
myself

on
my
lunch
hour
i
scurried
out
of
the
office
for
a
quick
bite
to
eat
and
found
myself
standing
at
the
corner
of
6th
and
congress
with
several
scary
looking
teenagers
who
appeared
to
be
in
some
kind
of
gang
the
odd
thing
they
were
all
signing
to
each
other
vigorously
obviously
an
outing
from
the
texas
school
for
the
deaf
just
down
the
street
i
am
sure
that
if
i
watched
long
enough
i
would
have
figured
out
how
to
sign
muthafucka
today's
outfit
is
a
repeat
of
this
one
i
have
been
doing
a
decent
number
of
repeats
lately
it
is
been
nice
because
i
am
still
semi
well
dressed
without
needing
to
think
much
the
only
thing
particularly
new
today
is
my
necklace
as
mentioned
before
i
have
realized
that
i
have
a
dearth
of
colorful
chunky
necklaces
in
my
wardrobe
i
started
poking
around
looking
for
jewelry
options
online
then
decided
it
might
be
cheaper
just
to
make
some
pieces
myself
so
i
ordered
a
bunch
of
beads
and
bits
from
fire
mountain
gems
so
far
i
have
only
made
one
piece
but
hopefully
there
will
be
more
to
come
these
are

with

and

sponged
on

blue
and

then
i
stamped
the

for
the

occupy
wall

is
relaunching
their
movement
today
on
this
may
day
2012
and
honestly
i
can
identify
with
them
in
some
respects
but
not
all
i
reject
their
communism
but
many
of
their
complaints
are
valid
and
worthy
of
fighting
for
the
global
bankers
are
fascists
and
they
have
a
long
history
of
financing
fascism
and
marxism
all
over
the
world
they
are
the
elites
and
we
are
the
serfs
and
if
you
don
t
believe
it
just
ask
them
and
they
ll
tell
you
just
how
much
of
a
serf
you
really
are
fact
is
these
fascists
red
elites
are
the
1
and
we
who
are
the
serfs
are
the
99
but
we
are
far
worse
than
mere
serfs
comrades
we
are
the
oppressed
and
the
demoralized
and
some
of
us
are
so
dumb
we
haven
t
even
figured
it
out
yet

see
a
psychological
film
the
angst
should
seep
deep
inside
somewhere
and
evil
does
take
over
the
way
it
is
shot
and
cut
hopping
from
one
condition
to
another
does
distract
some
times
as
always
on
this
anniversary
day
i
took
katie
to
visit
his
grave
jill
is
buried
in
the
same
cemetery
but
they
are
not
next
to
each
other
had
we
known
that
we'd
be
burying
jill
just
3
years
later
she
could
have
reserved
the
adjacent
plot
but
you
do
not
think
of
things
like
that
at
the
time
makes
me
happy

yes
i
know
this
is
not
exactly
the
healthiest
breakfast
out
there
but
it
sure
is
delicious
for
a
special
occasion
i
gave
my
scales
the
finger
this
morning
i
am
so
excited
i
can
not
believe
that
a
week
from
tomorrow
we
will
be
on
our
way
we
will
spend
sunday
with
a
good
friend
in
addis
and
then
take
custody
of
ruthie
mekdes
on
monday
but
those
aren
t
the
emotional
places
i
want
to
dwell
in
i
d
rather
think
about
the
tiny
miracle
inside
me
thank
for
it
and
celebrate
it
with
the
man
i
ll
be
spending
the
rest
of
my
life
with
and
the
quarks
are
invisible
in
frenzy
digging
around
for
hitchcock
anecdotes
is
like
trying
to
find
just
the
right
cup
of
sand
at
the
beach
the
problem
is
that
the
supply
is
inexhaustible
nevertheless
to
start
us
off
the
siren
is
offering
a
few
here
the
overall
economy
as
measured
by
the
gross
domestic
product
grew
at
an
annual
rate
of
5
6
percent
in
the
final
three
months
of
last
year
about
two
thirds
of
that
growth
came
as
companies
slowed
the
reduction
of
their
inventories
volunteers
come
in
all
shapes
sizes
and
backgrounds
most
often
the
recruitment
and
engagement
of
volunteers
is
on
a
level
playing
field
what
experience
and
skill
sets
are
needed
at
the
time
determines
who
in
the
applicant
pool
gets
the
nod
but
some
ngos
favor
volunteers
who
have
supported
the
organization
financially
and
otherwise
some
call
this
pay
to
play
and
it
is
an
issue
not
limited
to
organizations
that
recruit
pro
bono
lawyers
for
international
assignments
prospective
volunteers
need
to
know
and
understand
the
policy
of
the
sponsoring
organization
concerning
expectations
of
financial
support
we
like
to
home
educate
because
it
is
well
just
plain
good

thriller
starring
a
young

who
decides

of

organisation

random

the

the
most

character
trait
for
tiana
is
her
determination
she
s
a
hard
way
and
doesn

let
anything

sometimes
this
actually
becomes
her
biggest
flaw
but
in
the
end
she
finds
balance

with
it

not

feel
the
need
to
post
my
bloggity
diy
psychoanalytical
ramblings
but
life
is
getting
in
my
way
in
thought
garden
i
started
getting
into
my
angst
there
is
more
of
that
coming
but
i
find
myself
overwhelmed
with
details
i
promise
that
is
hard
that
means
i
have
to
do
it
to
post
something
mind
numblingly
boring
and
pertinent
only
to
me
within
the
week
it
is
no
secret
ad
agencies
like
bright
shiny
objects
especially
when
they
happen
to
arrive
in
the
form
of
advertising
awards
the
winner
of
the
whimsie
doodles
sponsor
prize
is
thanks
to
the
castrating
of
marriage
by
the
widespread
use
of
contraception
most
people
and
even
many
catholics
appear
to
think
that
its
primary
purpose
is
not
the
procreation
and
education
of
children
but
rather
the
celebration
of
romantic
love
between
two
people
until
recently
most
people
still
knew
there
must
be
some
reason
why
a
relationship
between
a
man
and
a
woman
was
different
to
other
human
relationships
sadly
though
such
is
the
society
that
we
live
in
in
which
children
often
take
second
place
to
rather
self
indulgent
adult
romances
that
it
appears
many
people
in
the
west
now
assume
that
the
only
purpose
of
marriage
is
for
the
good
of
the
spouses
regardless
of
their
gender
there
s
always
a
small
attention
pocket
in
my
brain
though
i
ll
often
stop
what
i
m
doing
and
view
the
world
through
9
year
old
eyes
or
i
ll
lie
in
bed
in
the
mornings
working
although
it
would
appear
that
i
m
just
gazing
into
space
and
snoozing
it
s
amazing
what
exciting
ideas
surface
through
the
haze
of
a
snooze
this

from
an
era

were

in

so

did
he
ever
tell
me
how
much
my

did
i
pay
for
that
at
this
point
i
am
still
not
sure
i
am
hoping
it
will
come
to
me
tomorrow
which
of
course
i
am
certain
will
entail
a
trip
into
tupelo
to
go
pay
for

i
was

taking

i
really
do
not

the

that
make
up

have
come
up
with

a

embodiement
of

and

the

two
often
fit

quite
well
rambling
around
this
weekend
collecting
random
beauty
and
a
few
interesting
somethings
to
show
you
it
s
hard
to
believe
that
it
has
been
that
long
since
i
held
her
in
my
arms
completely
in
awe
of
her
tiny
ness
and
even
more
in
awe
of
the
fact
that
i
had
a
daughter
a
psychic
had
told
her
father
that
i
was
carrying
a
boy
i
didn
t
have
a
strong
feeling
one
way
or
another
as
i
had
with
my
son
so
when
the
doctor
said
it
s
a
girl
i
was
glad
i
was
in
bed
or
i
would
have
passed
out
each
and
every
spell

and
full

the

the
team

goes
berserk
he
jumps
from
his
bed
and
stabs
doctor
adams
in
the
throat
and
she
crumples
to
the
floor
doctor
chase
attempts
to
subdue
the
patient
and
gets
his
throat
cut
and
is
spewing

he
then
unceremoniously
throws

out
the

window
doctor
foreman
rushes
in
with
a
security
team
and
moves
toward

to
tend
his
wounds
the
crazed
patient
charges
the
guards
and
a
security
officer
pulls
his
gun
in
panic
and
fires
his
aim
was
not
true
foreman
is
hit
and
lies
on
the
ground
dying
moments
later
the

is
subdued
but
adams

what
sort

should
inspire
i
think
children
aged
seven
to
eleven
or
twelve
or
so
are
at
a
golden
age
i
love
doing
talks
to
them
they
are
so
enthusiastic
and
receptive
and
just
generally
fun
and
i
agree
with
amanda
and
lyn
that
there
has
been
more
than
one
golden
age
of
books
written
for
them
but
listen
for
yourselves
inside
the
house
is
not
nearly
as
lovely
as
outside
its
all
clutter
cleaning
projects
that
make
me
wince
like
my
carpet
needs
a
serious
cleaning
ah
the
joy
of
owning
three
large
dogs
living
out
in
the
country
without
the
blessing
that
would
be
hard
wood
floors
there
is
too
much
to
do
to
prepare
for
the
holiday
i
have
not
got
enough
hands
to
juggle
it
all
i
doubt
i
would
be
alive
now
not
all
which
has
been
done
has
been
with
malevolent
intent
i
rather
placed
my
credibility
on
the
line
by
linking
the
contraceptive
pill
to
genocide
in
an
earlier
part
of
this
essay
and
i
know
that
on
at
least
one
of
the
other
sites
where
my
earlier
articles
have
been
republished
some
people
who
have
not
done
what
i
asked
and
viewed
these
things
in
context
have
mocked
me
for
it
i
do
not
necessarily
believe
that
in
isolation
the
pill
was
developed
or
legalised
with
the
deliberate
intention
of
damaging
the
native
european
race
however
i
submit
that
it
has
done
so
and
as
i
stated
previously
its
introduction
on
the
scene
coincided
with
other
factors
which
in
combination
have
been
unremittingly
negative
nanay
and
tatay
had
sold
newspapers
and
empty
bottles
to
junk
shops
nanay
had
cleaned
comfort
rooms
for
a

while
tatay
drove
a
tricycle
that
s
how
hard
their
life
was
but
they
stuck
it
out
together
and
raised
five
children
who
now
take
turns
looking
after
them
you
can
and
should
participate
in
that
public
debate
by
interviewing
and
informing
candidates
by
speaking
out
and
writing
letters
to
the
editor
and
articles
for
local
newspapers
newsletters
and
blogs
by
talking
to
friends
relatives
fellow
workers
and
members
of
your
church
synagogue
or
social
service
organization
and
by
voting
for
candidates
who
most
closely
mirror
your
values
concerns
and
positions
on
key
issues

you
are

suddenly
we
decided
to
commit
to
each
other
the
feeling
love
does
not
required
any
reason
1
undescribed
we
let
shame
get
in
the
way
of
our
self
worth
we
think
less
of
ourselves
and
then
this
feeling
unworthy
affects
our
relationships
our
parents
siblings
friends
lovers
they
don
t
understand
why
we
think
so
little
of
ourselves
they
don
t
understand
why
we
can
t
look
them
in
the
eye
why
we
can
t
seem
to
feel
loved
we
take
our
feelings
and
put
them
onto
but
not
in
that
give
it
to
kind
of
way
instead
of
handing
them
over
dropping
them
at
his
feet
we
pile
them
up
as
high
as
we
can
all
our
issues
our
shame
and
we
let
it
form
a
wall
between
us
we
build
it
as
high
as
necessary
so
we
can
t
look
in
his
eyes
we
hope
he
can
t
see
ours
either
when
my
biological
ascension
process
started
in
february
1999
my
body
reacted
to
the
1999
and
later
solar
energies
with
those
lovely
ascension
flu
symptoms
body
and
bone
aches
chills
headache
and
the
occasional
sudden
stabbing
ice
pick
like
pains
in
certain
bones
for
a
couple
of
seconds
that
literally
took
your
breath
away
from
the
mid
1990s
on
i
ve
been
periodically
incapacitated
by
solar
energies
solar
flares
cmes
etc
and
was
forced
to
rest
and
or
nap
if
i
could
while
i
had
chills
severe
body
and
bone
aches
and
pains
and
numerous
other
ascension
symptoms
over
the
years
these
solar
triggered
ascension
symptoms
have
lessened
and
become
more
easily
dealt
with
not
because
the
energies
being
transmitted
have
lessened
since
1999
because
they
ve
steadily
increased
but
it
s
the
way
they
affect
our
bodies
and
why
that
s
changed
it
is
with
a
heavy
heart
and
unequivocal
tone
that
i
say
2012
has
been
an
absolutely
wretched
year
for
me
but
what
about
closer
to
home
what
about
so
called
racial
intolerance
freedom
of
speech
overzealous
policing
black
gangs
of
white
women
mass
immigration
free
housing
for
ethnics
at
the
expense
of
the
indigenous
population

let's
look
at

that
store
just
kills
me
first
of
all
we
do
not
have
the
same
selection
as
the
u
s
stores
and
secondly
i
would
never
shop
at
the
one
in
canada
because
of
the
prices
there
s
so
much
to
do
but
i
feel
good
about
the
progress
we
ve
made
considering
the
fact
that
we
re
working
so
much
while
trying
to
pack
and
clean
and
move
i
feel
much
better
after
a
red
bull
after
my
nap
i
m
hoping
tonight
goes
by
quickly
i
miss
my
big
girl
who
s
turning
one
next
week
i
can
t
believe
that
either
she
s
growing
so
fast
and
getting
even
more
beautiful

smarter

a
really
long
past
month
one
of
my
closest
friends
over
the
years
died
for
reasons
that
i
will
not

after
the
end
of
a

work
week
and
mentaly
preparing
my
self
for
his
funeral
tomorrow
i
decided
to
go
on

everyone

you
can
not
just
build
a
network
overnight
and
trying
to
do
so
will
just
turn
a
lot
of
people
off
to
you
do
not
try
to
be
so
uber
professional
that
you
seem
stiff
and
not
like
a
normal
person
unless
that
is
your
thing
which
is
cool
i
guess
but
i
probably
just
will
not
follow
you
and
do
not
try
to
get
others
to
promote
you
by
just
asking
everyone
individually
to
promote
you
what
have
you
ever
done
for
them
and
why
should
they
or
you
could
be
one
of
those
people
who
just
goes
around
following
others
so
they
will
follow
you
back
and
then
unfollowing
them
later
so
it
looks
like
you
have
waaaay
more
followers
than
people
who
you
follow
that
makes
you
cool
dontcha
know
that
is
not
only
dumb
but
it
is
also

jenny
and
i
talked
it
over
and
we
decided

let
her
stay

something
was
wrong

we
could
not

her

knowing

asked
me
again
if
i
could

told

i
could
not
and
that
i
had
to
go
to
work
i
asked
her
why
she
wanted
me
to
stay
with
her
and
she
said
she
did
not
know
she
just
wanted
me
to
be
there
i
reassured
her
that
jenny
would
be
there
with
her
and
that
we
could

got

makes

out

mostly
because
sister
really
really
thought
the
doll
was
alive

until
it
got
thrown
out

that

my
parents
both
worked
full
time
and
mom
had
to
return
to
work
6
weeks
after
i
was
born
so
my
great
aunt
took
care
of
me
i
was
with
her
for
about
twelve
hours
a
day
and
she
was
wonderful
i
used
to
feel
guilty
because
i
loved
her
more
than
my
mom
and
when
i
was
a
kid
i
thought
i
might
go
to
because
i
loved
her
more
than
my
mom
auntie
died
a
few
years
ago
and
i
still
miss
her
terribly
if
lofty
glances
from
lofty
people
it
is
all
sandra's
fault
she
is
currently
doing
posts
about
her
family
history
and
recently
did
a
rather
impressive
one
about
an
easter
outing
complete
with
bonnets
in
warley
halifax
about
1910
the
clothes
fascinated
me
and
it
reminded
me
of
this
photo
of
my
mum
and
grandma
the
back
of
the
picture
says
it
dates
from
1943
and
i
think
it
was
taken
in
bradford
the
family's
home
city
i
don
t
begrudge
the
americans
having
the
reputation
for
the
finest
imperial
stouts
nowadays
but
i
have
always
found
it
very
weird
that
so
little
was
brewed
in
the
country
where
it
was
invented
we
give
gifts
throughout
the
year
whether
or
not
there
is
a
specific
occasion
our
generosity
is
often
by
choice
but
we
are
also
spurred
by
cultural
traditions
and
social
obligations
and
for
reasons
varying
from
affection
to
reciprocity
to
entirely
self
serving
motives
with
each
presentation
there
is
a
message
thinking
of
you
thank
you
i
love
you
i
owe
you
you
owe
me
the
message
like
the
gift
is
personal
and
yet
it
can
also
project
beyond
its
giver
and
receiver
and
signal
outwardly
to
others
an
image
of
the
lives
of
and
relationship
between
the
main
participants
this
is
not
lost
on
marketers
and
advertisers
who
fill
airwaves
and
glossy
pages
with
ad
campaigns
depicting
rapturously
happy
people
exchanging
luxurious
presents
in
hopes
that
viewers
might
be
persuaded
to
emulate
them
through
their
purchases
at
the
very
least
they
have
succeeded
in
convincing
many
people
myself
included
that
the
highest
value
gifts
can
only
be
found
in
the
marketplace
i
know
some
of
those
folks
in
fact
i
love
some
of
those
people
if
mercy's
in
business
i
wish
it
for
you
thriftin
 
on
a
thursday
savvy
city
farmer
if
you
are
living
solely
for
yourself
than
your
life
is
considered
a
waste
our
personal
psychology
is
how
our
karmic
patterns
show
up
in
this
lifetime
a
general
buddhist
or
hindu
perspective
on
karma
suggests
that
the
individual
soul
moves
through
consciousness
lifetime
after
lifetime
incarnating
again
and
again
in
the
school
of
life
in
order
to
complete
various
tasks
and
lessons
and
to
release
contractions
of
consciousness
if
your
mum
s
not
available
why
not
do
some
research
amongst
your
customers
and
stakeholders
even
end
user
consumers
as
i
said
earlier
in
my
experience
the
man
on
the
clapham
omnibus
has
an
unerring
ability
to
spot
cant
inconsistency
and
blandness
what
is
more
just
as
ordinary
consumers
are
becoming
increasingly
au
fait
with
marketing
concepts
and
terminology
they
are
also
becoming
very
familiar
with
corporate
mission
statements
a
large
part
of
the
population
now
works
in
organisations
that
trumpet
their
mission
statements
whether
they
re
employed
in
the
private
or
the
public
sector
so
they
know
all
about
corporate
gibberish
and
how
it
feels
to
be
encumbered
by
a
nonsense
mission
statement
when
i
have
worked
with
consumers
on
developing
mission
statements
i
have
found
them
invaluable
in
helping
clarify
the
thinking
identifying
what
s
really
important
and
finding
distinctive
ways
of
expressing
it
i
just
had
a
cup
and
now
i
am
bright
eyed
and
bushy
tailed
i
had
to
have
some
coffee
because
i
was
somewhat
discombobulated
by
the
unofficial
nap
that
i
took
on
top
of
the
duvet
but
under
the
red
fleece
blanket
in
the
company
of
the
dog
since
it
is
a
cold
day
i
had
also
turned
on
the
heater
so
the
apartment
was
nice
and
warm
and
consequently
my
nap
lasted
longer
than
i
had
intended
7
50am
imagine
my
surprise
when
i
entered
the
building
at
the
address
and
did
not
find
the
pt
s
office
i
found
a
gym
what
aggressive
pt
therapy
at
this
place
i
thought
i
asked
the
person
at
the
desk
if
i
was
in
the
right
place
no
of
course
not
she
kindly
directed
me
to
the
new
location
where
the
pt
practice
had
moved
a
year
ago
not
only
can
you
not
marry
just
anyone
you
can
t
marry
everyone
either
though
some
of
us
have
tried
harder
than
others
believe
me
i
have
been
incredibly
open
hearted
in
my
choices
of
life
mates
it
s
time
to
get
smarter
so
while
it
may
seem
cruel
if
one
is
selecting
a
mate
it
s
entirely
understandable
even
necessary
to
be
very
selective
if
we
have
problems
with
garbage
dumped
in
parks
now
once
these
bins
are
in
play
that
will
steadily
worsen
it
is
a
funny
thing
just
yesterday
mother's
day
which
i
still
hate
i
was
missing
sophia
and
wondering
at
how
i
have
taken
to
avoiding
grief
and
even
this
blog
i
have
meant
to
write
often
but
always
found
a
reason
not
to
the
reason
has
largely
been
that
i
have
wanted
to
avoid
being
back
into
the
awful
world
of
grief
and
loss
i
have
wanted
to
deny
my
membership
of
this
club
of
angel
mommies
not
that
i
have
wanted
to
deny
sophia
never
but
i
have
wanted
to
avoid
the
raw
pain
of
this
world
second
it
is
quite
easy
to
definitively
show
that
this
whole
power
balance
scheme
is
just
a
big
fat
scam
just
take
a
look
at
how
skeptic
richard
saunders
and
his
crew
at
the
skepticzone
demonstrate
how
the
scam
works
success
list
if
you
ve
read
my
previous
posts
you
ll
know
i
believe
we
should
all
have
a
list
of
our
own
personal
success
definitions
mine
are
wellbeing
balance
courage
contentment
confidence
peace
love
and
joy
i
started
by
keeping
them
in
my
affirmations
book
and
would
read
over
them
every
chance
i
got
now
they
are
memorised
so
whenever
i
have
a
quiet
moment
i
recite
them
its
wonderful
no
one
else
will
know
but
in
that
moment
you
re
manifesting
the
life
you
desire
today
should
be
her
birthday
i
wish
i
could
call
her
and
tell
het
happy
birthday
and
tell
her
how
much
i
love
her
even
though
she
is
not
here
i
am
going
to
celebrate
her
life
anyway
and
i
m
going
to
focus
on
how
much
her
life
meant
to
me
and
how
much
better
my
life
is
now
because
she
was
once
a
part
of
it
up
next
i
went
with
the
pho
tay
their
buckwheat
o
tay
aged
in
the
phunk
barrel
i
would
say
the
main
lessons
that
came
from
the
books
was
to
believe
in
nothing
and
to
be
always
true
to
one
s
authentic
self
to
have
no
beliefs
at
all
i
know
that
this
statement
may
ruffle
a
few
feathers
here
is
why
this
teaching
lesson
is
so
important
to
think
about
when
you
have
a
strong
belief
about
something
or
many
things
it
could
be
about
anything
you
become
a
full
vessel
too
full
of
pre
conceived
ideas
to
learn
anything
new
or
different
beliefs
can
become
so
engrained
in
one
s
self
that
there
is
no
room
for
anything
else
a
strong
belief
can
be
very
hard
to
shift
especially
when
the
ego
begins
to
fight
another
idea
that
wants
to
replace
that
belief
we
have
an
emotional
attachment
to
beliefs
we
become
very
defensive
when
our
beliefs
are
challenged
the
defensiveness
is
ego
based
especially
if
those
beliefs
have
been
there
for
a
long
time
the
ego
does
not
want
to
learn
anything
new
it
wants
to
exist
and
stay
in
one
place
the
ego
will
fight
tooth
and
nail
trying
to
convince
you
of
why
and
how
that
belief
is
there
and
how
it
should
continue
to
stay
but
what
if
you
were
to
hear
or
learn
about
something
that
challenged
your
belief
so
much
that
you
began
to
question
your
beliefs
altogether
can
you
see
how
the
ego
would
create
a
huge
drama
and
story
about
your
beliefs
on
nearly
everything
and
so
there
is
a
constant
tug
of
war
and
fight
going
on
inside
you
when
you
are
a
full
vessel
you
are
full
of
ideas
concepts
opinions
and
beliefs
there
is
no
room
for
anything
else
when
you
are
an
empty
vessel
you
have
no
strong
beliefs
and
there
is
no
emotional
attachment
to
ideas
and
concepts
there
is
room
for
an
infinate
amount
of
learning
and
this
is
how
the
perfect
spiritual
student
functions
with
an
open
and
empty
mind

leave

ohh

just
woke
up
up
from
such
a
fun
dream
where
stasha
farrah
allison
bridget
and
shoes
were
all
hanging
out
with
me
we
were
laughing
and
having
fun
it
was
like
being
one
of
the
cool
kids
in
highschool
finally
then
i
woke
up
and
realized
in
a
way
i
do
get
to
hang
out
with
all
these
amazing
people
because
it
s
monday
which
means
i
m
back
and
ready
to
get
back
to
monday

so
yes
petro
said
mark
was
47
i
saw
him
around
aa
some
over
the
past
year
or
so
he
was
trying
to
stay
off
the
yet
it
had
a
profound
grip
on
him
and
made
his
last
months
a
terrible
for
both
him
and
his
parents
who
could
do
nothing
to
save
him
i
heard
the
news
at
work
yesterday
from
my
mother
and
went
right
over
to
their
house
they
were
ashen
yet
subdued
having
said
for
many
months
now
that
they
didn
t
expect
him
to
live
much
longer
may
grant
me
the
power
to
accept
that
i
am
not
and
i
can
not
solve
all
my
problems
myself
i
am
powerless

my
favourite
part
was
when
philppa
flipped
out
and
angus
tried
to
carry
on
the
show
over
her
rant
he
kept
running
around
and
speaking
all
of
the
lines
for
her
and
wayne
as
the
latter
looked
on
helplessly
either
that
or
when
he
was
playing
chess
with
himself
imagining
that
there
was
another
 
him
 
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
but
only
because
i
do
that
sometimes
i
started
cooking
some
cornbread
in
a
metal
football
shaped
pan
and
while
the
cornbread
was
cooking
i
remember
several
dream
scenes
let
me
start
off
by
saying
a
mere
5
months
ago
a
trip
to
our
new
mailbox
meant
bundling
up
and
running
out
to
it
as
fast
as
i
could
so
that
i
could
get
back
in
the
house
and
out
of
the
cold

for
the

it
was

sunny
this
day

of

enough
were
i
also
attended
an
art
forum
on
tuesday
which
discussed
financial
growth
in
the
arts
the
panel
shared
how
they
receive
an
income
and
work
as
artists
or
in
the
arts
field
some
did
not
want
to
explore
working
a
side
job
and
may
have
felt
like
it
would
be
a
compromise
in
making
that
decision
they
either
had
to
make
sacrifices
when
it
came
to
enjoying
certain
pleasures
of
life
or
created
a
life
around
their
artwork
which
paid
for
living
expenses
and
other
ventures
other
artists
structure
their
lives
by
working
for
a
company
building
a
family
and
creating
art
i
want
to
find
that
balance
live
comfortably
but
still
create
i
think
i
can
do
this
with
a
solid
plan
the
sentiment
was
stamped
on
the
banner
and
i
embellished
the
epoxy
glitter
circle
stickers
on
the
some
of
the
circle
layers
to
finish
off
for
others
it
is
like
a
handicap
a
cruel
joke
of
fate
to
be
ironed
out
with
every
tool
at
their
disposal
ghd
hair
irons
gels
styling
cr
mes
every
hint
of
a
curl
whispers
of
it
must
be
eradicated
ever
notice
though
how
when
their
hair
gets
wet
it
s
still
curly
she
is
going
to
new
york
one
of
our
major
pivot
points
happened
soon
after
we
had
won
the
competition
and
we
acquired
a
new
contract
with
a
school
most
of
the
previous
inventory
that
we
purchased
had
been
used
and
we
were
able
to
buy
at
a
very
discounted
price
but
for
this
new
school
and
for
growing
at
the
rate
we
planned
to
we
knew
that
we
had
to
get
financing
and
restructure
our
procurement
and
growth
processes
a
little
bit
we
needed
the
ability
to
purchase
more
expensive
new
units
again
being
part
of
cupid
s
cup
was
very
influential
with
this
because
of
their
partnership
with
bb
t
through
these
connections
we
were
able
to
acquire
a
loan
at
a
very
low
rate
and
now
have
a
solid
business
plan
and
financial
model
in
place
for
any
new
school
we
happen
to
form
an
agreement
with
over
the
past
couple
years
i
made
a
conscious
effort
to
not
answer
emails
right
away
more
recently
i
have
taken
the
more
drastic
step
of
completely
shutting
down
email
for
an
hour
or
two
each
day
allowing
me
to
focus
on
the
project
in
front
of
me
sometimes
i
do
this
a
couple
times
a
day
and
i
have
found
that
my
productivity
has
increased
dramatically
my
work
quality
has
improved
i
am
less
stressed
about
the
in
box
to
do
list
and
not
one
person
has
complained
about
me
responding
to
an
email
in
a
few
hours
rather
than
a
few
minutes
to
live
at
home
that
helped
me
get
to
the
emotional
core
of
joy
s
story
her
breaking
point
we
found
quite
a
few
missing
items
today
the
photo
above
shows
just
what
came
out
of
one
register
would
i
recommend
it
it
was
fun
different
a
neat
baking
experience
for
hannah
she
can
not
wait
to
make
a
new
cupcake
and
use
the
filling
insert
next
time
it
was
not
difficult
to
put
together
put
the
icing
on
and
fun
for
decorating
so
even
though
the
baking
time
was
a
little
much
if
you
have
been
thinking
about
adding
it
to
your
fun
or
creative
baking
supplies
i
think
you
will
be
happy

my
initial
reaction
was
to
wonder
at
the
absurdity
of
offering
three
options
nothing
seems
to
be
said
about
the
proportion
of
votes
required
for
any
single
option
to
be
deemed
the
winner
will
it
be
more
than
one
third
or
more
than
half
if
the
former
it
will
lack
legitimacy
if
the
latter
it
will
set
a
very
high
hurdle
for
each
option
40
for
staying
in
30
for
withdrawal
and
30
for
renegotiation
could
be
contrued
as
70
for
staying
in
but
trying
to
change
the
unchangeable
or
as
60
for
changing
the
status
quo
without
any
obligation
on
government
to
do
anything
about
it
either
way
it
is
completely
unsatisfactory
woodward
despite
the
raw
material
diterzi
s
creation
is
no
po
faced
litany
but
instead
a
vital
body
of
music
and
lyrics
that
engage
with
the
subject
as
though
its
ebb
and
flow
was
positive
uplifting
even
she
had
been
approached
by
argentinean
stage
director
marcial
di
fonzo
bo
with
the
idea
of
a
show
based
around
luxemburg
after
he
had
seen
her
on
stage
he
d
been
impressed
with
her
full
on
approach
and
equally
she
has
engaged
head
on
with
his
idea
creating
rosa
la
rouge
b
side
real
fantasy
is
just
an
electric
piano
and
a
single
direct
voice
still
playing
with
a
lot
of
fun
sounds
coming
up
with
a
bassline
out
of
a
stuttery
low
end
thump
and
looser
than
the
flipside
with
the
vocal
messing
with
a
nasaly
soul
sound
all
chopped
up
and
going
for
a
big
multilayerd
chorus
again
these
electronics
in
whatever
way
they
are
reassembled
sounds
completely
contemporary
like
a
rewinding
tape
recorder
in
the
late
 
90s
it
is
gigantically
playing
with
dj
tools
and
dance
culture
in
an
experimental
pop
way
with
a
sped
up
thin
acoustic
there
is
not
a
single
sound
that
has
not
been
processed
into
oblivion
for
the
sake
of
surprising
fun
playing
with
those
clear
precise
points
as
much
as
the
broad
swaths
of
hiss
because
dan's
not
keeping
it
completely
sterile
like
the
next
one
gave
away
and
broke
where
a
hyper
rhythm
becomes
a
larger
reference
point
like
a
crazy
experiment
to
take
an
impossible
bpm
and
build
anything
useable
around

impenetrably
dense
an
inconceivable

of

one
that
keeps
spinning
faster
and
you
try
not
to
holding
onto
that
metal
ring
in
the
center
and
like
with
any
film
it
had
its
heartaches
and
uphill
battles
but
what
survives
is
the
final
product
and
i
think
the
final
product
is
a
really
fun
film
that
s
cleverly
shot
it
had
a
pretty
successful
festival
run
and
was
a
milestone
in

time
to
at

wrap
up
this
award
claiming
process
and
to
pass
along
the
wealth
to
five
more
deserving
blogs
i
would
prefer
not
to
have
one
in
the
back
seat
of
my
car
one
day
she
said
she
had
to
leave
i
don
t
remember
why
i
think
she
had
to
go
home
to
take
care
of
her
father
some
of
my
relatives
speculated
that
she
was
going
to
get
married
before
she
left
i
made
her
a
terracotta
thing
that
spelled
her
name
i
gave
it
to
her
even
if
it
wasn
t
dry
it
looked
like
brown
but
i
wanted
to
give
it
to
her
from
then
on
i
didn
t
talk
to
the
maids
anymore
because
i
was
afraid
that
i
ll
get
attached
and
they
ll
leave
there
is

into

and

at

in
great
britain
wingate
and
chindits
became
household
words
churchill
invited
wingate
to
visit
him
in
england
and
then
he
took
wingate
and
his
wife
to
the
allied
strategy
meetings
known
as
the
quebec
conference
in
quebec
the
most
senior
allied
military
leaders
the
allied
combined
chiefs
of
staff
listened
to
wingate
with
interest
fortunately
wingate
dressed
for
the
occasion
and
the
allied
leadership
was
favorably
impressed
with
his
ideas
about
special
operations
clarabel
assured
me
b
was
the
answer
and
since
she
d
knit
this
pattern
before
was
more
likely
to
be
correct
than
me
after
mulling
it
over
for
sometime
i
realised
going
with
her
logic
b
instead
of
my
logic
a
meant
that
one
repeat
and
the
edging
would
take
more
yarn
and
thereby
i
would
be
less
likely
to
run
out
of
yarn
all
credit
to
wanting
to
maximise
yarn
for
stashdown
but
nobody
wants
to
run
out
during
the
cast
off
absolutely
tell
us
more
manish
elsa
we
were
seated
in
a
booth
on
one
side
of
the
dining
room
the
large
bar
was
a
focal
point
in
the
center
of
the
room
with
seating
around
the
perimeter
each
booth
had
small
pillows
so
that
one
could
adjust
the
distance
from
the
table
and
have
a
comfortable
back
rest
to
add
to
the
confusion
l
tells
me
he
is
seen
the
insurance
company
owner
mentioned
in
the
radio
statement
and
that
he
is
still
free
and
walking
around
no
one
knows
what
to
believe
or
who
to
trust
maurice
himself
is
the
one
certainty
he
could
explain
what
is
happening
given
the
chance
l
also
tells
me
that
people
in
st
paul's
are
ready
to
take
up
arms
to
defend
maurice
if
you
re
just
getting
down
with
us
you
may
want
to
know
how
it
all
began
when
dear
hubby
called
me
from
the
airport
this
morning
once
he'd
gotten
thru
security
he
said
i
hear
you
had
a
tornado
warning
last
nite
say
what
that
was
the
first
i'd
heard
of
that
i
do
remember
waking
up
sometime
in
the
nite
hearing
thunder
and
the
rain
pelting
the
roof
but
i
have
grown
to
love
the
sound
of
it
after
living
here
for
a
year
now
it
does
not
frighten
me
it
lulls
me
to
sleep
deep
sleep
obviously
dear
hubby
said
did
not
you
watch
the
weather
last
nite
i
told
him
whenever
he
is
gone
for
any
length
of
time
i
do
not
watch
tv
at
all
unless
i
decide
to
watch
something
i
have
taped
on
the
dvr
when
i
slid
the
drapes
shut
last
nite
around
8
pm
it
was
dusky
and
looked
normal
to
me
well
people
here
tell
us
michigan
weather
can
change
in
a
minute
and
i
guess
they
are
right
you
know
i
thought
i
heard
an
alarm
go
off
last
nite
but
i
thought
it
was
on
a
car
maybe
it
was
the
tornado
warning
i
do
not
know
when
i
picked
up
our
drapes
at
the
dry
cleaner's
this
morning
the
woman
who
helped
me
asked
me
if
we'd
had
any
damage
from
the
wind
last
nite
at
our
house
i
must
have
been
unconscious
i
did
not
even
hear
it
operations
updates
17
and
he
is
strong
i
am
talking
baby
hulk
strong
he
has
a
basket
of
toys
in
the
living
room
that
he
will
grab
and
dump
on
him
he
feeds
himself
his
bottle
and
good
luck
trying
to
take
the
bottle
away
before
he
is
done
you
have
to
fight
him
to
take
it
from
him
it
is
crazy
just
how
strapping
he
is
you
don
t
think
a
baby
should
be
able
to
be
stronger
than
you
this
issue
is
but
one
of
many
which
go
to
the
heart
of
the
credibility
of
the
man
holding
to
most
powerful
job
on
the
planet
yet
who
is
background
has
been
subjected
to
such
limited
scrutiny
even
if
as
the
latest
excuse
suggests
the
original
birth
certificate
was
shredded
in
2001
coincidentally
at
the
same
time
that
the
enron
shredders
were
doing
over
time
that
does
not
explain
why
the
american
president
who
makes
such
an
issue
of
his
commitment
to
openness
is
so
reluctant
to
be
open
about
his
own
history
first
off
getting
a
good
deal
is
subjective
is
it
worth
saving
500
1000
on
a
vehicle
to
have
your
paperwork
messed
up
poor
customer
service
promises
unfulfilled
and
a
generally
terrible
experience
or
is
getting
a
stellar
customer
experience
worth
the
extra
money
not
to
mention
the
time
savings
this
lady
is
taking
the
day
off
to
enjoy
some
shopping
and
lunch
in
the
city
i
was
quite
shocked
by
this
narration
unfortunately
the
article
left
many
unanswered
questions
how
did
macbain
make
the
transition
from
conservative
southern
baptist
to
mainline
united
methodist
what
kind
of
minister
she
is
in
the
united
methodist
church
this
is
important
because
it
would
reveal
how
much
formal
training
she
does
or
does
not
have
why
did
she
not
utilize
any
of
the
resources
available
to
united
methodist
ministers
counseling
mentoring
spiritual
direction
etc
see
i
know
there
is
really
santa
under
the
pines
in
my
mind
i
am
also
writing
children
s
books
that
inspire
awaken
and
delight
i
feel
that
a
strong
part
of
my
life
mission
involves
breaking
down
and
simplifying
information
this
applies
both
to
my
knowledge
of
spiritual
topics
as
well
as
english
language
for
children
and
adults
whether
that
be
through
teaching
writing
or
other
forms
of
communication
so
lately
there
have
been
a
lot
of
posts
about
blogging
fatigue
twitter
promotion
overload
here
and
here
and
the
state
of
blogging
in
general
also
many
bloggers
seem
to
have
hit
the
overwhelmed
point
and
are
either
thinking
of
stopping
altogether
or
doing
some
major
readjusting
and
as
i
read
through
these
posts
i
often
found
myself
nodding
my
head
because
i
share
many
of
the
sentiments
after
some
thinking
and
staring
at
the
wall
i
knew
exactly
what
i
wanted
to
do
i
shall
keep
you
updated
what
s
your
gingerbread
man
eating
style
me
i
snap
the
head
off
first
and
then
eat
the
left
leg
can
i
interpret
that
to
mean
i
am
an
achievement
oriented
natural
leader
with
a
sensitive
side
hickory
chair
is
my
go
to
furniture
source
they
have
some
of
the
best
upholstery
pieces
around
and
their
case
goods
are
to
die
for
i
love
them
because
almost
everything
is
customizable
to
the
length
of
a
sofa
to
the
finish
on
a
table
all
the
way
to
the
hardware
i
want
to
add
to
a
chest
they
also
have
some
pretty
big
names
creating
furniture
collections
for
them
thomas
o'brien
mariette
himes
gomez
and
suzanne
kasler
to
name
a
few
on
gossamer
wings
well
we
know
there
is
now
spf
15
in
it
that
is
a
plus
and
the
scent
is
the
same
praise
the
beauty
gods
i
love
the
smell
of
this
tanner
it
is
beachy
tropical
and
coconutty
and
it
masks
most
of
the
dha
smell
without
interfering
with
it
and
creating
some
hellish
putrid
hybrid
i
m
calling
this
batch
sunshine
muffins
and
not
just
because
they
re
such
a
lovely
golden
brown
the
flavor
last
week
was
lemon
and
sunflower
seeds
and
after
trying
one
of
these
babies
i
can
say
that
it
did
indeed
brighten
my
day
nicely
nestled
in
a
corner
shoplot
in
ss3
petaling
jaya
opposite
a
fenced
up
football
field
you
will
not
understand
the
power
and
the
beauty
of
your
youth
until
they
have
faded
but
trust
me
in
twenty
years
you
will
look
back
at
photos
of
yourself
and
recall
in
a
way
you
cant
grasp
now
how
much
possibility
lay
before
you
and
how
fabulous
you
really
looked
you
are
not
as
fat
as
you
imagine
i
don
t
know
i
like
radio
disney
radio
free
school
so
it
was
3
pm
on
the
day
of
the
gala
doors
were
supposed
to
open
at
6
45
and
i
still
had
nothing
scroll
our
friends
at
castor
pollux
brighton
have
just
announced
the
first
uk
exhibition
of
american
illustrator
charley
harper's
outstanding
work
to
say
we
are
excited
is
an
understatement
i
can
t
just
sit
back
and
do
nothing
he
told
his
mom
two
years
later
ryan
followed
his
beloved
older
brother
to
the
army
but
why
wouldn
t
you
learn
the
tools
you
need
to
give
yourself
the
best
chance
you
can
why
wouldn
t
you
learn
how
to
communicate
better
or
learn
how
to
deal
with
conflict
with
your
spouse
or
learn
what
the
unique
dynamics
of
a
stepfamily
are
then
you
will
be
ready
for
success
so
that
is
how
i
approached

simply
added
some
pretty

didjelirium
is
a
sick
individual
suffering
from
this
lethal
curse
called
humanitis
so
death
is
mainly
what
the
future
holds
for
didjelirium
maybe
in
200
years
from
now
on
if
there
are
still
humans
on
earth
i
sincerely
hope
not
for
the
sake
of
the
universe
someone
will
find
my
writings
and
or
hear
my
music
and
realize
how
prophetic
it
was
or
maybe
not
and
whatever
will
be
fine
meanwhile
i
shall
keep
rocking
my
foolish
boat
letting
aboard
all
the
other
foolish
dreamers
i
will
meet
on
the
way
and
telling
my
stories
to
whoever
might
be
crazy
enough
to
ask
about
them
most
of
them
are
being
gathered
in
this
project
called
original
fools
in
collaboration
with
damscray
from
orenburg
russia
and
i
can
t
but
advise
you
to
listen
to
it
simply
because
you
won
t
otherwise
if
you
need
a
genre
to
locate
it
on
the
music
map
we
do
what
we
call
spice
opera
it
s
a
lot
of
fables
about
distant
worlds
and
different
beings
that
somehow
live
and
act
exactly
like
earhtlings
it
might
interest
you
but
don
t
feel
sorry
if
you
don
t
i
ll
understand
i
never
expect
anything
from
anyone
so
i
m
always
happily
surprised
no
matter
what
for
the
most
important
is
not
the
destination
nor
any
final
goal
but
the
journey
toward
it
and
the
people
we
meet
on
the
way
so
let
the
music
play
filming
these
birds
with
their
rapid
darting
flight
is
not
too
difficult
as
long
as
it
is
just
a
broad
view
that
you
want
but
photography
is
another
matter
group
shots
are
not
too
tricky
but
focusing
on
individuals
is
another
matter
hence
the
blurriness
though
it
is
possible
to
pick
out
the
blue
head
and
the
white
flashes
on
the
underside
of
the
tail
that
doesn
t
happen
here
the

headline
is
at
odds
with
the

the
story
mentions
that
a
house
was
burned
down
by
firefighters
to
clear
the
site
for
the
new
town

but
that
s
pretty
far
to
ask
the

to
go

the
reason
barley
has
been
so
reckless
in
london
lately
including
leaving
behind
trails
of
weeping

is
because
he
inherited
a
romantic
list
and
hated
publishing
romantic
literature
he
claims
it
is
a
family
tradition
of
writing
novels
for
the
housemaid
that
he
is
getting
rather
tired
of
but
that
his
family
shareholders
i
e
his
aunts
will
not
let
him
publish
anything
else
he
did
not
show

and
got
to
spend
some
time
chopping
up

for

be

i
looked

after

when
british
prime
minister
david
cameron
and
french
president
nicolas
sarkozy
recently
gave
speeches
or
expressed
their
opposition
to
multiculturalism
it
made
news
when
it
turned
out
they
were
appalled
by
the
failure
of
this
idiotic
concept
germany
s
chancellor
angela
merkel
had
already
expressed
that
opinion
those
bottles
pictured
below
have
been
sold
out
for
some
time
now
as
technology
advances
further
people
are
becoming
entrenched
in

as
i
talk
more
tomorrow
about
all
of
the
coupons
that
are
available
to
print
on
the
internet
they
are
ecco
waves
objectively
of
course
i
recognize
that
they
are
not
much
to
look
at
sort
of
utilitarian
and
work
shoe
ish
however
i
love
them
i
saw
similar
attitudes
to
my
own
in
other
people
and
i
disliked
it
so
i
changed
this
was
really
a
big
one
i
heard
people
disrespecting
the
bride
of
christ
and
i
wanted
with
all
my
heart
to
defend
her
but
i
knew
i
d
been
guilty
of
the
same
thing
and
so
i
ought
to
cease
if
i
wanted
to
make
a
stand
sunday
afternoon
my
hubby
helped
me
finish
things
up
are
not
those
wonderful
when
i
show
this
quilt
in
the
show
this
summer
i
am
listing
her
as
the
co
creator
she
found
energy
in
the
quilt
and
let
it
be
seen
i
am
totally
blown
away
by
the
work
she
did
i
thank
you
for
this
day
and
i
pray
for
it
to
be
a
good
day
at
work
for
christi
and
for
me
i
pray
for
christ
s
thing
this
morning
give
her
confidence
and
success
and
let
her
know
that
you
are
right
beside
her
at
all
times
i
pray
that
she
will
be
able
to
go
through
her
day
looking
to
you
i
pray
that
stephanie
will
feel
better
as
her

has
been

turns
around
18
months
old
we
started
seeing
his
eyes
starting
to
migrate
inward
it
took
a
long
time
to
get
him
into
the
one
pediatric
opthamologist
in
maine
where
we
had
moved
we
started
patching
with
dialating
drops
since
he
would
not
keep
the
patch
on
and
he
got
his
first
pair
of
glasses
those
glasses
had
way
more
than
9
lives
those
poor
things
had
to
be
repaired
so
many
times
and
the
frames
replaced
from
being
mutilated
by
a

year
old

select
committee
declares
yesterday
was
much
hotter
than
we
have
had
in
the
past
week
97
degrees
and
muggy
when
it
is
muggy
and
hot
in
my
state
every
business
owner
turns
their
ac
down
to
32
degrees
this
is
not
fun
for
me
anytime
i
go
into
a
building
i
become
a
popsicle
i
literally
freeze
so
for
me
the
hotter
it
is
outside
the
more
layers
i
put
on
in
order
to
counteract
the
inside
temps
it
is
easy
for
me
to
remove
a
top
shirt
or
vest
while
in
the
car
and
pop
it
back
on
when
i
head
into
a
store
or
business
and
oh
what
beautiful
years
were
there
yesterday
may
was
holding
xander
after
his
feeding
time
and
she
watched
his
heart
rate
drop
from
the
normal
levels
of
145
or
so
down
to
under
100
the
alarm
went
off
and
his
heart
rate
continued
to
plummet
she
said
to
about
70
i
think
this
is
called
brachycardia
or
bradycardia
may
said
she
patted
xander
on
the
back
for
a
second
and
he
kind
of
moved
a
little
bit
and
his
heart
rate
went
right
back
up
to
normal
the
nurse
susan
said
she
thought
it
must
have
been
that
his
neck
was
back
a
little
too
far
as
he
was
resting
on
may
s
chest
and
perhaps
his
airway
was
constricted
or
something
so
it
i
m
not
sure
when
i
finally
accepted
that
he
wasn
t
coming
back
he
d
been
different
lately
distracted
moody
distant
we
d
always
had
a
great
relationship
or
so
i
thought
at
the
time
and
despite
the
big
difference
in
our
ages
we
were
still
brothers
and
he
always
sort
of
looked
out
for
me
mom
was
so
depressed
she
barely
left
her
bedroom
for
longer
than
it
took
to
microwave
up
a
cup
of
tea
spread
some
garlic
and
butter
on
a
piece
of
overtoasted
bread
then
tuck
another
dog
eared
romance
novel
under
her
arm
and
disappear
from
our
lives
again
with
the
quiet
click
of
the
door
pulled
shut
behind
her
the
main
building
of
lund
hospital
built
in
1968
it
is
both
impressive
and
most
of
the
historical
romances
i
read
practically
all
in
fact
take
place
in
england
so
it
was
really
interesting
to
read
a
story
set
in
a
more
familiar
place
i
loved
all
the
details
and
being
in
1899
i
found
it
so
fascinating
to
read
about
places
in
new
york
that
still
exist
tiffany
lord
taylor
mansions
on
5th
ave
etc
penelope
was
such
a
dreadful
i
felt
the
only
real
indication
we
had
that
elizabeth
had
some
personality
was
that
will
loved
her
so
she
must
have
had
a
side
to
her
that
was
a
little
more
warm
a
police
officer
a
zookeeper
a
fire
fighter
an
artist
what
is
an
unexpected
purchase
that
you
have
made
lately
i
could
go
on
but
quite
frankly
it
just
started
getting
rambling
and
disorganized
to
a
greater
degree
it
almost
reminded
me
of
that
last
scene
in
inherit
the
wind
where
the
prosecutor
after
losing
the
case
start
rambling
in
a
plea
just
to
be
treated
like
he
was
important
rick
did
not
have
the
manners
to
exit
as
gracefully
as
the
character

david
hoyle
a
democrat
from
gaston
county
says
he
heard
similar
arguments
from
government
officials
decades
ago
when
city
halls
were
eager
to
get
in
on
the
business
of
selling
electricity
several
dozen
north
carolina
towns
including
wilson
joined
to
buy
a
share
in
utility
owned
power
plants
and
now
their
residents
pay
some
of
the
highest
power
bills
in
the
state
the
middle
aged
man
would
rally
as
all
parents
must
do
in
the
end
the
moral
of
this
story
is
of
course
that
the
dollar
store
rules
expensive
shoes
lie
and
jillian
michaels
will
yell
at
you
but
you
can
always
mute
her
or
something
like
that
cunning
plan
i
agree
but
insofar
reasonably
sensible
like
anything
so
far
made
sense
ed
as
things
go
here
is
where
it
gets
really
scary
though
i
was
working
on
a
computer
in
college
a
computer
that
had
basically
been
on
for
several
months
with
nothing
significant
happening
to
it
whatsoever
linux
ftw
but
the
moment
i
unloaded
my
computer
to
check
email
etc
while
the
other
computer
was
computing
and
my
phone
for
no
real
reason
in
front
of
it
and
left
it
unmanned
for
about
five
minutes
it
had
hung
massively
completely
un
recoverably
hung
and
i
blame
my
cellphone
s
evil
intentions
it
saw
an
eventuality
that
it
had
not
planned
for
and
it
improvised
and
it
improvised
really
well
that
you
understand
these
contradicting
ways
then
all
bets
on
your
swiftly
waning
lungs
ultimately
the
bad
things
that
happen
to
us
by
random
chance
belong
to
the
texture
of
life
they
aren
t
a
sign
that
you
have
been
singled
out
or
cursed
they
don
t
indicate
that
you
have
sinned
or
that
hates
you
the
fact
that
we
react
so
drastically
to
accidents
reveals
something
deeper
that
the
texture
of
normal
life
is
a
thin
layer
of
security
beneath
which
deeper
waters
stir
we
will
discuss
those
deeper
waters
in
the
next
post
confession

i
have
learned
that
mistakes
are
meant
to
be
learned
from
and
not
repeating
so
the
remaining
years
that
i
may
be
graced
with
will
be
full
of
less
regrets
as
possible
there
are
only
a
few
followers

to
see
her
totally
run
with
it
first
last
before
after
ahead
behind
the
other
night
was
a
little
different
the

she
opened

one
would
almost
forget
that
this
is
the
nation
that
not
too
long
ago
was
producing
some
of
history
s
most
revered
athletes
we
re
still
playing

kim

johnny

and
valerie
brisco
among
a
host
of
others
we
had
tommie
smith
john
carlos
jim

and
charlie
greene
simultaneously
yet
we
re
happy
to
have
one
tyson
we
had
butch
reynolds
steve
lewis
danny
everett
and
michael

all
at
the
same
time
not

having

my
point
is
that
right
now
we
d
be
ecstatic
to
have
just
one
of
those
per
event
yet
we
used
to
produce
them
in
bunches
well
here
is
my
entry
for
the
sunday
on
corrosive
challenge
blog
i
m
in
this
clean
and
simple
mood
so
i
came
up
with
this
keep
things
simple
as
the
days
seem
to
be
just
flying
by
before
we
all
know
it
christmas
will
be
here
is
everyone
finished
their
cards
the
last
time
mercury
was
retrograde
directly
opposite
your
sign
was
in
september
2009
this
is
always
an
indication
that
you
have
to
face
old
issues
with
partners
especially
ex
partners
it
could
mean
you
are
similarly
dealing
with
old
issues
with
close
friends
as
well
whatever
the
case
all
this
stuff
is
back
on
your
plate
again
oy
the
downside
of
mercury
is
feeling
frustrated
with
delays
but
the
upside
of
mercury
and
incredibly
there
is
an
upside
is
that
you
can
quite
easily
expedite
things
or
finish
things
or
bring
them
to
a
conclusion
now
would
not
it
be
nice
to
get
rid
of
this
once
and
for
all
some
of
you
however
are
not
dealing
with
old
issues
you
are
just
running
into
ex
partners
and
all
that
that
implies
yikes
the
countdown
to
the
first
day
of
school
is
continuing
one
week
and
counting
hehehe
manchild
is
not
real
happy
about
this
i
am
sure
the
kitties
and
i
will
have
a
twinge
of
loneliness
nah
her
child
should
have
been
able
to
bring
the
bible
home
and
flip
through
it
read
some
of
it
ask
questions
etc
that
is
part
of
the
learning
process
her
child
may
agree
with
that
viewpoint
and
belief
more
than
his
mothers
oh
heaven
forbid
or
maybe
not
this
project
took
me
less
than
an
hour
from
start
to
finish
it
was
really
simple
i
forgot
to
take
a
picture
of
it
before
i
cut
it
all
up
69
schmoozing
for
free
stuff
on
a
girls
 
night
we
always
sat
still
and
listened
when
we
went
to
mass
but
every
once
in
a
while
one
of
us
might
get
a
giggle
that
we
could
not
stop
and
even
though
there
were
5
of
us
my
mom
could
be
sitting
at
one
end
of
the
pew
and
you
could
be
the
last
kid
in
the
other
end
but
she
could
still
reach
you
with
a
pinch
we
kneeled
at
mass
anyway
so
she
settled
for
a
pinch

maybe
that

something
i
have

for

i
have
finally
come
to
a
conclusion
there
is
no

no

it
just
is
which

my

by
an

over

there
was
a

laura
was
strong
enough
to
know
that
what
was
going
on
in
their
marriage
was
not
a
we
thing
but
rather
a
him
thing
and
she
was
powerful
enough
to
know
that
she
wasn
t
being
rejected
it
wasn
t
because
of
anything
she
had
done
jeans
i
am
obsessed
with
jeans
when
you
play
with
fire
sometimes
you
get
burned
and
other
times
you
get
a
baby
and
as
i
have
said
before
very
few
moments
are
easy
it
is
hardly
ever
the
classic
definition
of
perfection
but
somehow
it
is
still
so
stinking
awesome
loss
of
sleep
loss
of
money
loss
of
independence
these
are
all
true
to
some
extent
there
is
no
denying
it
but
the
gains
are
worth
more
than
any
of
those
things
they
are
better
than
any
trip
i
have
taken
better
than
any
size
i
have
ever
been
better
than
any
piece
of
furniture
i
could
have
bought
any
car
i
could
be
driving
walking
down
the
memory
lane
back
into
the
1912
wasn
t
easy
given
limited
resources
about
one
of
the
deadliest
tragedy
in
the
world
none
of
us
were
excited
to
resurrect
the
memories
of
a
dead
ship
every
one
of
us
had
clashing
opinions
about
the
crash
which
were
the
wonders
of
our
brain
it
was
like
digging
a
grave
of
skeletons
for
autopsy
hoping
to
find
a
lead
on
a
happened
a
decade
ago
it
seems
impossible
for
us
to
craft
a
dying
tale
of
a
man
who
was
dead
before
he
got
to
the
end
of
his
story

put
it
into
a
plastic
container
cover
the
kimchi
with
a
piece
of
plastic
wrap
so
it
is
not
exposed
to
air
put
the
lid
on
and
let
it
sit
at
room
temperature
not
in
direct
sunlight
for
a
day
and
a
half
taste
it
every
now
and
then
if
it
tastes
like
it
is
starting
to
ferment
then
it
is
ready
to
go
into
the
fridge
do
not
put
it
in
before
otherwise
you
will
just
end
up
with
lifeless
kimchi
but
if
you
wait
too
long
to
put
it
in
it
will
be
too
sour
and
tangy
so
be
careful
the
view
from
the
deck
was
sure
different
the
water
was
just
lovely
and
relaxing
sitting
out
there
in
the
morning
drinking
coffee
and
watching
the
wildlife
was
almost

waking

screaming
every
2
hours
from
teething
but
do
not
want
to
start
a
habit
is
it
just
easier
or
is
it
because
she
is
your
last
child
and
you
want
to
savor
it
or
are
you
just
sparing
the
other
kids
from
having
to
share
a

with
her

a

the

of

since
the

s

before
extolling
its
success
told
you
it
was
a
fab
sketch
i
know
you
will
love
playing
with
it
my
teamies
as
always
have
created
some
amazing
inspiration
for
you
all
looking
forward
to
checking
out
your
lovely
creations
i
posted
these
tips
because
a
i
think
they
re
interesting
and
b
i
need
to
learn
to
resist
my
officemate
s
cookies
but
as
much
as
these
tips
and
tricks
are
being
used
to
encourage
healthy
eating
cunning
marketers
may
also
employ
similar
tactics
in
the
hopes
of
getting
you
to
make
the
less
healthy
choice
learning
to
recognize
and
avoid
these
marketing
tactics
may
be
just
as
important
as
putting
them
to
use
after
a
few
days
of
watching
her
feed
the
cats
i
noticed
that
she
always
wears
a
jean
jacket
this
jacket
is
decked
out
in
rhinestones
that
say
cat
lover
followed
by
a
bit
of
bling
strategically
placed
on
the
jacket
upon
further
observation
i
see
her
license
plate
says
the
same
thing
i
also
want
to
share
about
autumn's
progress
i
am
actually
nervous
to
type
this
out
because
everytime
i
comment
on
how
well
autumn
is
doing
something
goes
wrong
and
we
take
2
steps
back
but
i
believe
is
answering
our
prayers
on
healing
maturing
autumn's
brainstem
this
week
i
keep
wanting
to
pinch
myself
because
i
honestly
could
never
imagine
this
time
would
come
i
know
god's
powerful
enough
but
never
was
sure
if
it
would
be
in
his
will
to
give
us
that
miracle
we
have
hoped
for
autumn's
oxygen
saturations
have
stayed
between
97
100
all
day
this
is
not
normal
for
autumn
she
goes
into
the
70
 
s
80
 
s
about
10
times
daily
sometimes
turning
dusky
she
also
has
gagging
episodes
which
makes
her
desat
as
well
well
this
week
we
have
only
a
couple
of
gagging
episodes
and
within
5
days
she
is
desatted
into
the
80
 
s
only
2
times
we
have
rarely
had
to
suction
her
and
she
is
been
more
alert
and
cooperating
with
her
therapists
and
all
over
the
house
exploring
i
even
took
her
out
yesterday
by
myself
and
never
had
to
pull
over
to
suction
her
even
when
she
coughed
coughs
usually
turn
into
gagging
fits
and
then
turning
dusky
i
do
not
want
to
get
my
hopes
up
that
this
is
actually
the
miracle
we
have
been
praying
for
and
then
we
step
back
again
but
i
know
this
too
is
also
in
god's
perfect
timing
so
i
ask
you
keep
on
praying
along
with
me
that
god's
will
be
done
in
autumn's
life
as
well
and
that
this
is
the
miracle
we
have
been
praying
for
part
of
the
state
has
been
i
would
be
a
fool
to
try
and
go
against
his
system
frog
hops
with
weight
16
reps
maybe
that
makes
me
old
fashioned
but
it
is
what
it
is
i
am
not
trying
to
change
the
world
or
make
an
impact
with
these
thoughts
i
am
just
writing
what
i
feel
to
get
my
juices
flowing
this
is
mainly
for
me
maybe
there
are
more
like
me
but
if
there
are
i
am
hoping
that
they
will
answer
the
door
when
i
knock
that
obviously
means
that
you
should
believe
most
of
the
time
only
some
things
that
you
read
and
hear
unless
it
is
based
on
scripture
that
s
the
only
absolute
thing
the
key
thing
is
to
always
ask
why
whichever
song
becomes
the
next
hit
ask
why
do

hard
i
almost
my

it
needs
at

one
polish
before
i
send
it
out
to
betas
and
i
am
not
sure
the
first
act
does
not
need
a
bit
of
rocket
fuel
but
overall
i
am
pleased
with
the
book
it
is
more
complicated
than
everything
else
i
have
written
it
is
the
first
novel
i
have
written
from
a
detailed
and
thorough
outline
which
helped
a
lot
despite
the
fact
that
i
deviated
from
the
outline
to
the
tune
of
10
15
000
words
and
i
think
the
good
bits
are
the
best
stuff
i
have
yet
written
like
every
downy
bearded
blow
in
i
dreamed
of
becoming
a
latter
day

boy
all
that
is
left
of
these
efforts
is

have
you
ever
watched
as
it
changed
i
like
to
say
i
do
these
mad
things
so
that
you
do
not
have
to
but
actually
it
is
because
i
have
very
poor
impulse
control
what
you
think
love
is
what
is
love
supposed
to
feel
like
a
k
g
nair
group
director
pearl
academy
of
fashion
said
we
have
some
of
the
most
creative
minds
amongst
us
but
exposure
and
access
to
the
best
resources
ideas
and
talent
from
around
the
world
is
key
to
success
having
someone
like
angela
missoni
share
her
experiences
with
our
students
is
part
of
our
efforts
to
create
a
truly
global
and
relevant
industry
experience
at
pearl
y
for
yippee
if
muslim
immigration
and
through
it
the
rate
of
growth
of
the
muslim
population
itself
cannot
be
brought
under
control
which
is
to
say
stopped
in
perpetuity
then
british
towns
and
cities
will
continue
to
undergo
a
rapid
process
of
colonization
by
their
various
muslim
peoples
this
process
of
colonization
will
have
one
very
unusual
characteristic
normally
technologically
and
economically
more
advanced
peoples
colonize
peoples
who
are
less
advanced
in
these
regards
this
is
why
try
as
they
might
the
native
american
indians
could
not
effectively
oppose
much
less
reverse
the
colonization
they
underwent
at
the
hands
of
the
british
and
other
european
peoples
however
in
our
case
the
opposite
will
be
true
as
our
colonization
will
be
taking
place
at
the
hands
of
technologically
and
economically
inferior
peoples
who
barring
the
odd
afghan
on
the
back
of
a
truck
have
to
be
let
in
by
our
immigration
apparatus
to
be
here
at
all
i
am
still
asked
if
this
is
for
certain
the
last
baby
even
by
people
that
know
hub
had
a
vasectomy
yes
it
is
100
it
is
it
has
been
5
months
since
hub
had
it
done
and
i
am
more
happy
and
content
with
the
decision
as
time
goes
by
but
when
vika
arrived
at
her
first
orphanage
the
workers
gave
her
a
birth
date
and
guessed
at
her
age
as
she
was
found
on
the
street
with
a
mom
who
never
claimed
her
the
exact
information
was
never
known
she
was
given
the
birthdate
of
january
19
and
it
was
estimated
she
was
around
seven
years
old
this
weekend
my
daughter
has
another
meet
the
home
meet
is
never
my
favorite
because
we
have
to
work
it
last
year
my
husband
did
video
for
all
five
sessions
and
i
put
in
hours
making
notebooks
for
them
to
sell
and
of
course
use
huge
loads
of
sunscreen
with
high
spf
the
fight
between
pro
slavery
and
anti
slavery
activists
as
to
whether
kansas
would
become
a
state
or
a
free
state
was
one
of
the
early
confrontations
that
triggered
the
civil
war
popular
vote
would
decide
whether
or
not
kansas
would
become
a
free
state
large
groups
of
both
pro
and
anti
slavery
activists
poured
into
kansas
to
decide
the
outcome
which
at
times
escalated
into
violent
confrontations
and
many
of
these
battles
were
centered
in
and
around
lawrence
finally
on
january
29
1861
kansas
was
admitted
to
the
union
as
a
free
state
less
than
three
months
before
the
battle
of
fort

began

i

as

be

ann
said
she
felt
that
the

knocked
her

len
thought
it
had

but
it
didn

quite
deliver
to
get
started
first
sit
comfortably
at
the
patient
s
head
with
the
top
of
the
head
resting
on
a
towel
facing
your
chest
and
the
body
away
from
you
if
that
sort
of
a
massage
bed
is
not
available
then
sit
on
the
bed
and
pillow
the
patient
s
head
in
your
lap
placing
an
absorbent
towel
on
your
lap
make
sure
you
re
comfortable
and
your
back
rests
against
a
headboard
keep
a
jar
or
bottle
of
the
patient
s
favourite
moisturiser
handy
dab
a
little
of
the
moisturiser
on
your
fingers
each
time
you
start
to

a
certain
area
of
the
face
my
sweet
friend
recently
lent
me
her
family's
old
cookbooks
to
peruse
i
love
the
cookbooks
but
my
favorite
thing
is
seeing
which
little
slips
of
paper
and
newspaper
clippings
people
stuff
inside
these
old
cookbooks
these
are
some
of
the
greatest
recipes
in
my
family's
cookbooks
so
i
made
sure
to
copy
down
some
of
my
friend's
too
here
is
a
great
one
i
found
enjoy
kissed
um
dave
robicheaux
i
think
james
lee
burke
is
just
one
of
the
most
astonishing
writers
forget
about
literary
fiction
crime
fiction
genre
fiction
he
s
just
amazing
he
s
got
the
soul
of
a
poet
and
every
book
just
seems
fresh
to
me
and
very
few
people
manage
to
create
a
series
character
where
they
can
do
that
this
is
how
one
student
that
kebokile
encountered
talked
about
her
study
abroad
experience
in
botswana
one
may
well
ask
why
does
a
study
abroad
program
include
an
elephant
ride
there
may
of
course
be
many
reasons
buying
tickets
for
exchange
students
may
help
feed
the
elephants
and
their
drivers
for
example
perhaps
students
from
other
countries
will
gain
an
appreciation
for
this
mighty
animal
through
this
close
contact
but
i
tend
to
suspect
that
the
main
reason
may
be
that
the
program
organizers
are
trying
to
find
something
to
entertain
these
students
and
are
drawn
to
the
touristic
appeal
of
the
country
s
wildlife
as
a
way
to
give
the
students
something
to
to
do
and
maybe
something
to
talk
about
back
home
kebokile
is
not
trying
to
take
away
the
elephant
ride
but
rather
to
help
the
students
put
this
experience
in
the
context
of
the
complex
reality
of
elephant
herds
in
botswana
their
impact
on
crops
other
species
the
economy
and
the
controversy
around
culling
the
herds
how
might
a
serious
pre
trek
or
post
trek
discussion
of
this
article
influence
what
the
students
took
home
from
the
experience
distinction
between
them
and
the
rest
of
mankind
even
as
their
lord
was
i
wanted
to
be
out
cycling
around
the
lake
early
running
errands
mailing
letters
i
am
mentally
and
physically
fatigued
from
the
previous
stressful
work
week
right
now
in
this
moment
i
don
t
feel
like
doing
any
thing
christ
s
body
was
broken
to
save
the
souls
of
the

i
learned
about
kiva
a
few
years
ago
when
one
of
my
sisters
who
runs
this
etsy
shop
suggested
that
all
our

donate
money
to
the
charity

instead
of
giving

a

have
a
lovely
weekend
see
you
when
i
get
back
lets
hope
the
weather
stays
like
this
for
a
few
days
more
i
have
spent
the
better
part
of
the
hour
on
edenfantasys
website
there
are
sooo
many
things
to
look
at
and
so
many
things
to
choose
from
i
love
it
okay
and
let
me
be
a
bit
honest
here
when
i
say
i
am
not
the
least
bit
adventurous
when
it
comes
to
 
alone
time
 
with
my
husband
lol
i
just
cant
let
loose
or
get
creative
im
really
just
not
sure
what
the
deal
is
but
there
you
have
it
i
am
not
adventurous
much
to
my
husbands
dismay
so
when
i
told
my
husband
i
would
be
doing
a
review
for
this
company
you
can
imagine
his
genuine
shock
and
after
the
shock
came
the
laughing
at
me
and
saying
ya
right
lol
i
cant
blame
him
men
are
just
way
more
open
when
it
comes
to
things
like
this
and
maybe
there
are
a
lot
of
women
who
are
too
i
dont
know
i
just
know
that
i
unforunately
am
not
one
of
those
women
well
there
are
so
many
ladies
here
and
so
little
time
as
we
were
leaving
marianna
said
all
those
old
ladies
will
miss
you
there
has
been
a
large
outcry
from
people
who
want
to
contribute
to
my
campaign
despite
my
penniless
campaign
pledge
i
had
resisted
for
the
longest
time
but
i
do
not
want
to
disappoint
all
those
people
who
want
to
contribute
i
will
have
a
one
time
money
bomb
on
the
31st
of
this
month
this
will
be
the
only
time
i
will
accept
contributions
the
money
raised
from
the
campaign
will
be
used
for
things
like
ad
time
yard
signs
and
tattoos
there
will
be
more
information
in
the
days
to
come
in
this
3
bedroom
1
bath
rental
house
that
we
call
home
even
i
am
amazed
at
how
much
detail
i
can
take
in
of
what
is
happening
to
me
every
kick
blow
cut
and
scrape
i
feel
i
can
see
the
faces
of
the
angry
mob
the
brotherhood
of
insane
okada
riders
who
like
moths
drawn
to
a
flame
have
now
drowned
me
in
a
sea
of
heads
sticks
cudgels
and
petrol
the
right
have
always
had
a
core
vote
and
this
has
naturally
grown
over
the
years
certainly
the
bnp
have
become
more
prominent
but
it
is
not
this
that
has
augmented
such
voting
patterns
thee
primary
factor
has
been
the
changed
street
the
altered
demographic
and
the
besieged
bewildered
and
the
angry
white
indigenous
community
yet
such
a
non
core
vote
is
hard
to
keep
angry
frightened
individuals
little
interested
in
politics
want
action
and
they
want
it
now
they
vote
for
the
bnp
and
see
little
to
no
change
next
time
they
either
decline
the
invitation
to
vote
using
the
they
re
all
the
same
argument
or
they
place
their
approval
elsewhere
yet
the
core
vote
of
the
right
remains
almost
wholly
fixed
some
drop
out
but
in
the
main
it
stays
constant
so
we
see
that
thee
overriding
factor
for
the
growth
of
the
rights
vote
has
been
the
changing
face
of
our
nation
therefore
the
racial
question
is
still
relevant
still
worth
addressing
they
failed
to
do
so
i
am
more
grateful
than
words
can
accurately
express

talked
about
his
general
rejection
of
identity
formation
as
a
means

liberation
to
deleuze
zeroing
in
on
a
identity
would
inevitably
just
limit
a
group

who
could
be
vastly
different

them
together
by

common
trait
even
if
that
trait
itself
is
a
unique
individual
experience
this
identity
would
not
really
designate
what
this

is
it
would
only
remove
the
possibilities
of
what
a

can

utilizing

more

acceptable

you
will

careful

on

appropriate

the
appropriate
audience

cognizant
of
the
need
for

effective
methods
right
now
i
ve
got
my
curves
back
because
i
ve
had
time
off
i
m
at
home
cooking
i
m
more
relaxed
i
m
not
defined
by
being
seven
pounds
heavier
than
i
was
two
months
ago
i
think
it
is
really
unhealthy
to
go
there
i
will
be
seeing
him
again
this
weekend
for
one
of
the
rugby
guys
 
weddings
i
asked
him
last
weekend
if
he
was
going
and
he
said
he
was
and
said
he
was
not
bringing
his
girlfriend
because
he
did
not
think
it
was
appropriate
now
why
would
it
be
appropriate
to
date
her
but
not
bring
her
i
think
he
was
worried
i'd
start
something
with
her
which
i
would
never
do
at
someone's
wedding
i
would
however
make
sure
that
none
of
my
friends
talked
to
her
which
means
the
only
person
that
she
could
conversate
with
would
be
her
boyfriend
i
kinda
wish
she
would
go
just
so
i
could
see
it
serious
question
what
in
s
name
is
so
interesting
about
the
hunger
games
i
mean
all
it
is
really
is
a
bunch
of
kids
killing
other
kids
it
has
the
exact
same
concept
that
the
japanese
movie
battle
royal
has
the
movie
itself
is
lacking
in
gory
deaths
and
it
just
has
to
contain
the
friggin
romance
didn
t
we
get
enough
of
that
in
the
twilight
series
my
personal
bias
rose
out
of
my
chest
within
seconds
of
getting
into
town
i
love
delhi
nothing
against
mumbai
but
if
i
could
choose
one
indian
city
to
spend
the
rest
of
my
life
in
it
would
be
delhi
in
fact
delhi
may
be
third
on
my
list
of
best
cities
right
behind
1
new
york
and
2
san
diego
clean
streets
great
public
transportation
and
thousands
of
years
of
history
layered
beneath

feet
delhi
is
fantastic
then
i
am
quickly
reminded
of
that
thanksgiving
soldiers
who
had
expected
to
be
participating
in
great
battles
found
themselves
drilling
in
mud
from
morning
to
night
an
epidemic
of
homesickness
spread
through
the
troops
once
upon
a
time
in
america
we
can
tell
our
grandchildren
there
used
to
be
this
great

ideal
is
becoming
one
of
my
favourite
haunts
for
a
friday
now
but
viv
has
labeled
it
central
because
we
were
later
than
usual
i
was
not
given
the
best
of
seats
which
meant
i
had
to
stand
to
cabeceo
i
resisted
the
temptation
to
walk
around
the
room
for
at
least
an
hour
but
from
where
i
was
i
had
little
option
i
could
not
even
get
a
dance
with
my
mataderos
lady
until
i
went
on
walk
about
i
now
know
her
name
is
theresa
i
told
her
my
wife
says
we
are
as
good
as
married
because
we
had
three
dances
together
she
laughed
and
said
i
am
too
old
for
you
i
had
a
tanda
with
the
french
lady
that
i
did
chacarera
with
last
week
and
after
she
introduced
me
to
her
husband
we
did
chacarera
again
naturally
beckett
has
to
roll
her
eyes
when
they
listen
to
the
911
call
charlie
made
after
witnessing
the
attack
test
results
confirm
though
that
he
and
david
were
bitten
by
the
same
person
and
then
ryan
plays
a
bit
of
a
security
tape
that
shows
a
tall
figure
looming
and
wandering
toward
the
parking
garage
at
the
time
of
death
the
camera
zooms
in
to
his
face
a
decayed
face
that
bears
a
human
soul
happy
may

everyone
to
start
off

we
have
brand

i
have
been
watching
your
back
whispered
to
my
quietened
soul
last
week
over
2
years
since
he
had
spoken
those
words
from
isaiah
yes
he
had
been
my
rearguard
my
life
that
is
my
soul
had
been
left
intact
the
chaff
had
been
separated
from
the
wheat
the
battle
was
over
and
i
was
on
my
way
home
from
now
on
eventually
he
became
accustomed
to
being
outside
most
of
the
time
one
night
he
got
confused
and
went
to
the
neighbors
sliding
glass
door
and
tried
to
get
in
thank
goodness
they
knew
the

had
a

does
a

for
them
but
then
she
s
grabbed
again
this
time
by
the
same
russian
mob
that
we
met
at
the
film
s
outset
an
article
in
today's
telegraph
regarding
the
current
situation
of
rebel
fighters
refusing
to
either
go
home
or
disarm
carries
the
questionable
headline
as
lawlessness
spreads
are

good

turning
bad
this
rather
pre
supposes
the
notion
that
the
rebels
were
ever
the
good
guys
to
begin
with
rather
than
a
rag

bunch
of
extremists
known
terrorists
and
some
fighters
who
genuinely
believed
in
the
cause
of
deposing

gaddafi
smrt

are
having
delays
and
disruptions
on
an
almost
daily
basis
that
even
the
mainstream
media
has
stopped
reporting
on
it
altogether
my
first
card
is
one
i
did
for
a
challenge
at
joans

a
wonderful

check
it
out
if
you
have

she
carries

will
order

if
you
haven

read
the

then
we
ll
talk
by
panic
at

it
is
time
now
the
notion
that
china's
development
model
of
a
strong
political
leadership
that
effectively
manages
social
and
economic
affairs
provides
an
alternative
to
western
democracy
and
market
economies
for
other
developing
countries
to
learn
from
it
s
your

but
things
didn
t
go
as
smoothly
as
we
d
hoped
this
morning
when
we
got
to
rikers
going
through
security
and
waiting
for
an
took
much
longer
than
expected
and
unfortunately
it
really
cut
the
time
for
the
mock
trials
short
the
mock
trials
were
supposed
to
be
held
in
the
gymnasium
but
because
the
religious
services
were
being
held
there
at
the
same
time
that
wasn
t
possible
the
religious
services
are
normally
held
in
a
separate
chapel
area
but
because
it
s
under
construction
services
must
be
held
in
the
gym
on
sunday
mornings
that
s
alright
but
there
was
a
lack
of
communication
so
we
had
to
have
the
mock
trials
take
place
in
their
living
areas
where
we
have
been
conducting
the
sessions
all
semester
today
we
brought
8
dozen
boxes
of
donuts
for
the
guys
as
a
treat
but
we
had
issues
getting
that
through
since
the
captain
on
shift
this
weekend
would
not
allow
it
he
protested
because
apparently
the
donuts
are
considered
contraband
and
he
wouldn
t
allow
them
to
pass
through
since
he
was
not
aware
of
any
clearance
for
them
although
we
had
clearance
through
the
higher
ups
this
seemed
not
to
have
been
communicated
to
the
appropriate
people
so
at
first
they
confiscated
the
donuts
which
was
so
frustrating
but
we
ended
up
getting
them
back
only
problem
was
2
dozen
of
the
8
dozen
were
not
given
back
to
us
ridiculous
but
unsurprising
and
on
top
of
that
the
certificates
for
the
guys
were
not
printed
out
as
they
should
have
been
another
lack
of
miscommunication
i
guess
they
ll
have
to
receive
them
another
time
long
sigh
i
had
my
endoscopy
today
i
chose
not
to
be
sedated
for
it
and
that
may
have
been
a
mistake
because
it
turns
out
my
gag
reflux
is
strong
especially
when
a
nurse
is
holding
your
head
hard
against
an
exam
table
while
the
doc
fishes
for
images
in
yoru
stomach
i
puked
up
slime
three
times
and
since
the
nurse
was
holding
my
head
down
had
to
lay
in
it
until
the
doc
was
done

times
the

the

many
people
have
written
me
to
ask
how
i
came
up
with
mojoey
the
answer
is
simple
i
did
not
come
up
with
it
like
any
nickname
it
was
given
to
me
by
others
i
ve
had
many
nicknames
over
the
years
every
thing
from
red
to
the
mad
irishman
to
big
guy
and
even
grumpy
a
friend
from
work
even
calls
me
shrek
which
i
think
is
halariouis
i
picked
up
mojoey
by
way
of
a
linguistic
accident
while
working
in
france
in
99
the
staff
of
the
facility
i
was
working
in
referred
to
me
a
gros
joe
pronounced
grow
jo
now
grow
jo
was
not
a
pretty
nickname
they
were
making
fun
of
me
because
i
was
twice
their
average
size
and
weight
i
was
not
offended
but
some
of
my
american
co
works
were
quite
taken
aback
by
this
they
resolved
to
find
me
a
better
nickname
also
the
l
r
channels
are
reversed
due
to
a
re
wiring
 
glitch
 
which
nobody
mentioned
whilst
there
was
the
 
opportunity
 
ha
ha
was
there
risk
a
little
bit
but
it
was
so
worth
it
risk
means
that
things
will
go
wrong
occasionally
that
is
life
it
involves
risk
every
time
you
do
anything
original
or
creative
you
take
a
risk
if
you
let
young
people
have
adventures
they
will
sometimes
get
hurt
sometimes
even
get
killed
but
very
very
rarely
in
the
uk
we
are
so
lucky
that
adventures
here
are
relatively
safe
and
we
ought
to
be
letting
our
young
people
have
them
however
painful
it
is
for
us

i
said
no
thanks
under
normal
circumstances
i
would
try
and
try
to
convince
kurt
to
eat
but
these
were
not
normal
circumstances
nothing
about
this
move
was
normal
everything
was
up
and
down
and
in
the
air
this
wasn
t
a
tangible
situation
i
couldn
t
see
or
touch
or
feel
this
project
coming
to
life
because
we
had
only
just
begun
and
so
far
we
were
stubbing
our
toes
on
the
process
although
our
journey
on
the
prairie
had
only
just
begun
it
seemed
as
if
we
had
spent
a
lifetime
in
the
little
trailer
that
i
was
working
hard
to
keep
from
becoming
a
rat
hole
as
my
husband
walked
past
me
without
a
word
more
i
inhaled
a
deep
breath
bit
my
tongue
shut
my
mouth
and
carried
on
with
cooking
the
meal
kurt
went
to
bed
lying
there
fully
clothed
under
a
blanket
i
served
my
dinner
on
a
paper
late
to
avoid
washing
a
dish
and
wondered
about
things
as
i
sat
there
at
the
table
alone
as
i
ate
in
silence
the
meatballs
were
delicious
and
i
remarked
to
myself
that
the
italian
breadcrumbs
eggs
and
fresh
minced
onion
made
all
the
difference
when
making
meatballs
in
brown
gravy
maybe
it
was
because
i
prefer
all
things
italian
how
could
i
not
but
in
this
case
there
was
no
denying
that
the
bland
and
basic
flavor
of
brown
gravy
and
ground
beef
rolled
into
was
much
improved
with
the
touch
of
onion
garlic
basil
and
oregano
as
i
appreciated
every
bite
of
my
meal
i
contemplated
a
second
helping
but
felt
self
conscious
hogging
the
tastiness
of
this
well
cooked
dinner
especially
if
kurt
was
only
lightly
sleeping
and
could
hear
me
going
for
another
trip
to
the
pan
and
if
he
was
in
a
deep
sleep
then
the
sound
of
me
rattling
lids
to
pans
and
scraping
up
gravy
with
the
metal
spoon
certainly
would
wake
him
so
quietly
i
made
my
way
down
the
steps
after
closing
the
heavy
metal
door
with
a
trepidatious
click
after
walking
up
to
the
hydrant
to
fill
the
water
jugs
stopping
by
the
big
house
to
pop
in
and
say
hello
to
brenda
and
the
rest
of
the
family
i
made
my
way
back
to
the
trailer
to
drop
off
the
water
jugs
and
then
i
walked
out
the
paddock
gate
to
head
over
to
the
slice
of
land
in
a
world
that
was
supposed
to
become
our
new
home
the
dogs
followed
me
of
course
never
allowing
me
to
go
anywhere
without
them
they
were
quick
to
tap
on
my
heels
in
order
to
and
protect
as
we
walked
up
to
the
farthest
corner
of
the
land
that
now
had
our
name
on
it
the
prayer
corner
was
the
only
place
on
earth
now
where
i
could
tune
everyone
out
enough
to
commune
with
and
be
still
in
thought
meditation
prayer
devotion
and
contemplation
to
find
solace
i
had
to
walk
away
to
my
little
church
on
that
farthest
corner
of
our
pasture
standing
there
the
dogs
would
lie
down
for
a
nap
now
knowing
after
a
full
month
of
walking
here
that
we
would
be
a
while
yes
we
had
been
in
three
forks
more
than
a
month
now
so
looking
back
was
a
good
thing
maybe
maybe
we
had
achieved
more
than
it
felt
like
we
had
but
then
the
wallet
emptied
out
as
if
we
d
been
here
for
ten
years
i
was
worried
beyond
fear
but
praying
helped
me
to
remain
calm
enough
that
i
didn
t
become
crazy
over
it
praying
helped
to
control
my
rattling
nerves
the
general
consensus
seems
to
be
that
the
three
records
they
released
in
1969
what
we
did
on
our
holidays
unhalfbricking
and
liege
lief
are
the
band
s
best
and
that
what
followed
was
a
slow
and
steady
decline
certainly
the
departure
of
sandy
denny
their
key
attraction
at
that
point
was
a
major
blow
and
the
band
s
infatuation
with
esoteric
traditional
material
ensured
that
it
wouldn
t
have
much
more
than
a
cult
following
still
they
released
plenty
of
solid
albums
in
the
70s
most
of
which
made
little
impact
at
the
time
and
are
today
only
beginning
to
be
rediscovered
case
in
point
pitchfork
reviewed
the
reissues
of
what
we
did
on
our
holidays
and
unhalfbricking
giving
them
high
ratings
of
8
8
and
9
3
respectively
without
so
much
as
mentioning
the
10
or
so
other
albums
of
theirs
that
had
also
been
reissued
i
followed
the
cold
breeze
to
the
front
door
it
was
wide
open
i
had
entered
the
house
through
the
garage
who
left
the
front
door
wide
open
just
as
i
was
deciding
whether
to
flee
out
the
front
door
or
run
back
in
and
rescue
my
iphone
boyfriend
and
ipad
goddess
from
the
clutches
of
a
probable
serial
killer
i
saw
the
ups
truck
pull
away
from
the
curb
and
then
i
noticed
that
just
inside
the
front
door
was
a
package
from
amazon
oh
good
the
book
my
daughter
wanted
had
arrived
putting
two
and
two
together
i
realized
that
the
ups
guy
put
the
book
inside
of
the
house
and
yelled
hellooooo
because
the
front
door
was
wide
open
the
petition
has
drawn
criticism
from
other
doctors
and
families
of
same
couples
and
yesterday
prompted
victoria's
chief
psychiatrist
to
issue
a
statement
defending
professor
george
even
after
the
facts
were
exposed
this
political
bigot
dan
rather
kept
foolishly
and
insanely
insisting
that
the
story
was
true
even
if
the
document
wasn
t
and
the
sky
is
pink
although
it
appears
blue
the
final
dimensions
of
this
crib
toddler
duvet
will
be
28
x
51
if
you
want
to
make
one
for
a
standard
size
bed
just
keep
in
mind
to
double
or
triple
the
width
of
the
fabric
to
account
for
the
gathers
his
vision
was
blurring
but
he
looked
up
through
the
car
windows
to
see
someone
standing
on
the
other
side
he
reached
his
right
arm
up
with
an
open
hand
the
figure
on
the
other
side
of
the
car
leaped
into
the
air
and
landed
on
the
roof
of
the
cruiser
collapsing
it
several
inches
the
man
looked
up
at
what
he
had
thought
to
be
a
boy
but
the
boy
was
shirtless
and
extremely
muscular
the
boy
smiled
and
leaped
again
he
crashed
down
harder
and
caving
the
roof
so
it
touched
the
headrests
of
the
front
seats
unfortunately
my
pictures
taken
with
an
iphone
do
not
do
the
piece
justice
but
they
will
give
you
some
idea
this
video
is
of
much
better
quality
and
it
gives
you
a
much
better
sense
of
what
to
expect
because
there
are
so
many
somewhat
competitive
seats
on
each
side
of
the
ledger
there
really
is
an
extremely
wide
range
of
possibilities
for
what
could
happen
next
year
certainly
in
the
last
few
election
cycles
most
of
the
close
races
have
all
ended
up
going
in
one
direction
or
another
so
you
could
see
republicans
whittle
the
number
of
democratic
seats
down
to
the
low
50s
if
they
have
a
good
year
as
expected
but
if
somehow
things
get
turned
around
for
democrats
to
have
a
good
year
they
could
climb
up
well
into
the
mid
60s
a
father
who
has
plans
don
t
all
fathers
grace
s
does
at
least
and
grace
agrees
with
them
except
does
this
sound
absolutely
delicious
to
anyone
else
most
people
i
mention
this
to
seem
to
scrunch
their
faces
up
in
disgust
i
do
not
know
about
the
lager
style
of
which
i
have
to
assume
they
are
talking
about
light
lager
with
the
light
lager
insinuation
aside
there
is
something
about
beer
ham
cheese
and
waffles
just
gets
me
all
excited
i
have
not
made
this
recipe
yet
but
i
will
most
definitely
not
use
a
light
lager
i
was
thinking
more
along
the
lines
of
wheat
beer
or
maybe
go
full
on
adventurous
and
make
a
half
a
batch
of
stout
waffles
now
that
is
what
i
am
talking
about
anyone
have
a
waffle
iron
for
sale
it
is
lovely
truly
lovely
congratulations
nana
connie
please
email
me
at
stampandcreate
bellsouth
net
with
your
mailing
address
and
i
will
send
you
your
gift
certificate
love
it
sometimes
i
struggle
with
a
sketch
but
this
one
had
me
right
from
the
start
and
i
knew
just
how
i
wanted
to
tackle
it
i
flipped
the
sketch
for
my
take
i
also
used
a
stamp
set
that
we
will
be
releasing
later
this
month
as
a
little
sneak
peak
for
you
all
you
seriously
are
going
to
love
this
set
here
is
my
card
and
graced
our
property
recently
i
asked
radford
what
she
was
reading
her
reply
i
m
almost
embarrassed
to
admit
it
but
i
m
currently
rereading
mansfield
park
for
oh
about
the
87th
time
i
have
a
bit
of
a
jane
austen
obsession
not
only
is
she
a
beautiful
timeless
writer
but
there
is
also
something
so
soothing
about
her
novels
that
elegant
sweep
towards
a
well
ordered
ending
that
i
reach
for
them
a
little
as
if
they
were
comfort
food
i
always
notice
something
new
on
each
rereading
this
time
it
was
the
brilliantly
waspish
way
she
managed
to
pin
down
a
character
mr
rushworth
in
half
a
sentence
he
was
a
heavy
young
man
with
not
more
than
common
sense
a
salutary
lesson
on
the
power
of
brevity
i
did
find
as
usual
that
i
was
cheering
on
the
villains
of
the
piece
the
witty
lively
amoral
mr
crawford
and
his
sister
while
despairing
at
her
supine
goody
goody
of
a
heroine
price
in
this
novel
it
almost
feels
as
though
austen
is
arguing
against
herself
painting
liveliness
as
a
dangerous
quality
and
championing
a
docile
downtrodden
girl
who
could
not
be
further
from
her
usual
strong
minded
protagonists
elizabeth
bennett
seems
like
a
much
more
instinctively
written
and
likeable
heroine
yes
i
must
have
read
pride
and
prejudice
192
times
i
m
still
enjoying
mansfield
park
though
there
is
something
so
irresistible
about
the
triumph
of
the
underdog
narrative
running
through
it
that
i
m
sure
this
will
be
far
from
my
last
rereading
vats
returns
so
if
like
me
you
re
an
appalling
shot
in
real
time
you
can
pause
the
action
choose
a
limb
and
let
loose
that
way
instead
thankfully
my
favourite
aspect
from
fallout
3
the
mysterious
stranger
perk
is
present
and
correct
here
as
well
which
helped
me
out
on
many
occasions
he
looked
at
the
door
handle
that
he
had
just
touched
it
he
touched
it
again
to
neutralise
it
but
that
didn
t
help
the
results
are
comical
and
somewhat
humiliating
i
can
brush
my
hair
and
my
teeth
and
put
on
most
items
of
clothing
however
a
bra
is
going
to
be
tricky
for
fun
i
tried
on
a
sports
bra
one
handed
and
it
worked
out
ok
but
it
is
amazing
how
much
twisting
and
jiggling
and
adjusting
is
necessary
to
make
it
fit
properly
with
two
working
hands
much
less
one
i
am
sure
i
would
have
won
a
funniest
video
award
if
it
had
been
on
tape
thank
it
is
not
on
tape
i
think
that
a
bunch
of
the
rest
of
this
pattern
is
going
to
go
much
faster
as
the
scales
are
no
where
near
as
elaborate
as
on
the
green
dragon
and
there
is
sky
over
water
which
is
much
more
solid
to
book
i
don
t
have
an
answer
i
tweeted
early
on
watching
belle
de
jour
that
if
someone
could
explain
the
fascination
60s
french
films
have
with
these
sorts
of
strange
portrayals
and
glamorization
of
prostitution
that
i
would
buy
them
a
drink
or
cookie
if
isn
t
your
thing
the
offer
still
stands
in
the
meantime
i
will
continue
to
hope
that
answers
make
themselves
apparent
over
time
my
final
pieces
for
shipherd
s
record
need
to
be
in
by
saturday
april
1
that
was
the
deadline
given
by
molly
goaly
head
of
public
relations
at
olivet
college
i
wrote
a
piece
about
this
year
s
running
night
it
originally
wrote
it
for
the
echo
geared
to
students
and
the
new
version
of
for
shipherd
s
record
geared
towards
alumni
i
read
through
the
article
and
edited
it
i
am
also
including
blurbs
from
alumni
from
the
60
s
and
70
s
about
being
greek
most
of
the
alumni
work
at
the
college
but
i
got
a
couple
who
are
out
in
the
world
i
was
looking
for
alumni
who
are
still
involved
with
their
houses
have
careers
and
who
have
fond
memories
of
being
greek
at
olivet
college
is
your
heart
filled
with
i
remember
that
the
weight
loss
program
i
did
before
when
i
lost
100lbs
had
this
rule
or
at
least
i
think
that
is
the
weight
loss
program
i
got
that
nugget
from
there
have
been
so
many
they
all
run
together
my
intention
for
weighing
myself
monthly
is
prevent
the
emotional
roller
coasters
i
would
experience
and
have
been
if
i
weighed
weekly
and
daily
hopefully
this
too
will
encourage
me
to
rely
more
on
how
i
feel
and
look
to
gauge
the
success
of
the
program
rather
than
on
a
number
i
will
weigh
myself
on
the
first
of
every
month
actually
i
am
sure
i
have
heard
various
experts
say
things
to
the
effect
that
you
can
not
make
things
any
better
at
this
point
but
you
can
absolutely
make
them
worse
so
in
the
interest
of
avoiding
injury
and
tired
legs
i
am
resisting
my
impulse
to
over
exercise
and
just
keeping
it
light
i
have
even
pretty
much
convinced
myself
to
take
two
full
rest
days
before
the
marathon
instead
of
sneaking
off
to
the
y
on
friday
morning
for
a
final
shot
at
the
elliptical
i
think
okay
i
am
not
completely
firm
on
that
but
i
am
leaning
toward
not
going
i
will
probably
be
doing
my
last
minute
packing
then
anyway
starting
right
away

resorted
to
the
worst
kind

soon
the

be
on

warning
about

doesn
t
it
feel
awful
when
you
finish
a
puzzle
and
find
that
there
are
missing
pieces
i
used
to
think
so
i
took
a
photo
of
this
puzzle
because
i
was
going
to
send
it
to
the
manufacturer
to
see
if
i
could
get
replacement
pieces
incidently
this
puzzle
is
called
the
world
s
smallest
puzzle
i
think
it
was
only
like
8

10
when
completed
i
was
cleaning
not
too
long
ago
to
have
friends
over
for
dinner
and
i
moved
the
table
under
the
leg
of
the
table
were
two
puzzle
pieces
each
not
too
much
bigger
than
1
3
square
so
i
never
saw
the
puzzle
completed
but
i
added
the
pieces
to
the
can
so
that
the
next
gullible
person
who
completes
the

will
get

a
co
worker
who
is
home
sick
and
could
not
get
out
we
just
burned
our
last
bag
of
fossil
fuel
the
newly
delivered
firewood
has
to
be
stacked
inside
the
old
dog
pen
it
is
perfect
for
the
purpose
as
it
has
tall
wood
framed
sides
lined
in
stiff
wire
sitting
on
a
dry
concrete
slab
i
am
going
to
put
some
pvc
hoops
across
the
top
to
form
a
tunneled
roof
support
and
cover
them
with
sheet
plastic
we
thought
about
using
it
as
a
mini
greenhouse
but
it
is
better
as
a
wood
store
right
outside
the
back
door
we
used
to
burn
the
smokeless
compressed
coke
that
gives
off
tons
of
heat
over
a
long
period
costs
a
bomb
and
leaves
useless
toxic
ashes
we
are
now
using
sustainable
wood
that
leaves
a
lovely
ash
residue
the
ashes
will
now
be
used
for
a
potassium
additive
in
the
soil
and
have
chosen
to
slow
down
and
be
more
deliberate
in
design
and
construction
while
the
cupcakes
were
cooling
i
stuck
on
the
pies
with
some
garlic
bread
the

arrived
for

we
all
sat
enjoying
our

which
really
were
delicious
and
catching
up

they
left
at
9
30pm
our
sides
were
hurting
from
regaling
stories
from
over
the
last
few
years
english
major
though
i
read
a
lot
i
don
t
consider
myself
well
read
i
concentrated
more
on
writing
right
to
assembly
negated
by
violence
i
avoided
writing
blogs
due
to
this
thought
and
started
finding
reasons
as
inadequate
time
the
truth
is
that
i
used
to
watch
movies

the

the

becoming
more
widespread
for
retired
people
in
california
nobody
wishes
to
live
in
their

but
that
is
becoming
the
reality
and
increasingly
will
continue
to
for
retirees
who
have
been
honest
honourable
hard
working
citizens
as
they
watch
their
pensions
depleted
by
wall
street
at
the
same
time
that
landlords
and
care
homes
have
to
raise
rents
to
pay
the

next
up
we
have
a
fun
bright
card
with
a
sweet
reminder
to
remember
the
little
things
in
life
by
gini
williams
cagle
i
really
got
hacked
off
with
the
whole
d
railleur
set
up
two
years
ago
when
sunny
portsmouth
and
southsea
got
covered
in
literally
millimetres
of
snow
it
may
have
been
as
much
as
a
whole
2
cm
the
snow
was
still
fresh
when
i
left
for
work
that
morning
so
i
thought
i
d
risk
my
winter
compound
but
still
slick
road
tyres
i
use
continental
ultra
gatorskins
if
your
interested
an
excellent
tyre
in
my
humble
opinion
despite
what
other
fools
may
say
i
estimate
i
ve
covered
about
4500
miles
on
them
with
no
issues
flats
or
otherwise
as
it
transpired
i
needn
t
have
worried
about
the
tyres
i
got
to
work
with
no
slips
or
falls
the
gears
on
the
other
hand
were
a
right
mess
the
gain
is
not
a
surprise
at
least
not
as
i
look
back
on
how
i
ate
this
week
i
had
fast
food
three
maybe
four
times
this
week
i
had
two
or
three
sodas
to
drink
per
day
i
did
not
drink
anywhere
near
enough
water
at
work
i
also
had
a
blt
kinda
week
at
work
if
i
could
put
it
in
my
mouth
i
did
bites
of
cheese
licks
of
sauce
tastes
of
cake
and
cookies
add
to
that
the
fact
that
the
previous
week
i
did
none
of
my
nightly
exercises
and
still
am
not
doing
my
sit
ups
and
push
ups
again
what
is
been
interesting
me
lately
is
how
other
people
have
the
power
to
make
you
feel
a
certain
way
perhaps
i
am
alone
in
this
but
i
feel
like
my
whole
being
changes
depending
on
who
is
around
me
with
some
people
i
feel
like
a
strident
maniac
around
others
i
feel
myself
recoil
my
voice
becoming
almost
shy
and
unsure
some
people
make
me
feel
like
i
have
to
lead
and
be
in
charge
some
people
make
me
feel
girlish
and
superficial
others
make
me
feel
butch
some
people
make
me
feel
others
make
me
feel
irritatingly
pompous
answer
me
this
readers
does
this
happen
to
you
as
well
there
are
very
few
people
who
i
can
be
around
and
feel
simply
myself
this
a
guy
made
me
feel
extremely
comfortable
and
at
ease
and
he
seemed
to
be
a
very
generous
and
kind
spirit
he
came
with
me
to
collect
my
student
card
from
the
office
and
as
i
was
around
trying
to
open
the
enveloppe
he
took
my
stuff
off
me
so
i
could
do
it
properly
i
really
appreciate
little
gestures
like
that
then
he
was
craning
his
neck
trying
to
read
the
blurb
and
had
a
few
questions
about
how
to
register
how
to
get
a
french
phone
etc
i
just
found
him
very
touching
becomes
less
there
seems
to
be
a
continuous
battle
between
negative
and
positive
thoughts
in
your
mind
and
the
truth
is
that
the
winner
of
that
battle
is
a
reflection
of
your
current
life
situation
whether
your
situation
is
amazing
or
not
very
good
it
is
a
result
of
who
wins
the
battle
in
between
your
ears
the

award
off
i
went
into

and
up

been
up
to

mr
wight
was
called
as
a
crown
witness
formally
but
this
as
a
courtesy
to
mr
sheridan
after
confirming
his
details
to
the
prosecutor
mr
sheridan
began
what
was
in
effect
cross
examination
of
mr
wight
however
he
too
was
not
asked
the
detailed
and
precise
questions
a
professional
advocate
would
have
done
and
was
not
pinned
down
on
areas
where
otherwise
there
might
have
been
difficulties
peter
amor
takes
his
bow
tie
to
elgoods
a
brewery
like
you
have
truly
never
seen
before
that
is
over
200
years
old
the
young
whippersnappers
who
took
it
over
are
now
in
their
fifth
generation
and
there
is
a
lovely
laid
back
feel
to
peter's
brewery
chat
the
endless
production
of
tomatoes
not
only
from
my
own
garden
but
also
the
garden
at
the
farm
has
changed
that
i
have
found
myself
with
so
many
tomatoes
that
i
just
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
them
all
one
can
only
use
so
much
salsa
pasta
sauce
plain
sauce
pizza
sauce
and
tomato
soup
i
found
myself
searching
for
something
else
to
make
use
of
these
glorious
red
orbs
and
landed
on
tomato
jam
and
went
through
all
sorts
of
heartaches
at
serenity
falls
we
found
a
beautiful
waterfall
as
well
as
some
rental
cabins
one
of
the
cabins
was
right
at
the
base
of
the
waterfall
that
of
course
was
too
big
a
temptation
for
betsy
and
me
so
we
just
had
to
book
a
few
nights
at
serenity
falls
then
of
course
i
am
moving
too
slow
i
am
moving
too
fast
and
now
they
think
i
am
going
without
them
i
stepped
on
someone's
hat
i
dressed
that
one
first
and
this
one
wanted
to
go
first
this
one
is
screaming
at
me
this
one
is
going
for
a
time

are

of

english
pidgin
english
originated
as
a
form
of
communication
used
between
native
and
non
native
english
speakers
in
hawaii
it
supplanted
the
pidgin
hawaiian
language
used
on
the
plantations
and
elsewhere
in
hawaii
it
has
been
influenced
by
many
languages
including
portuguese
hawaiian
and
cantonese
it
also
has
been
influenced
to
a
lesser
degree
by
the
spanish
spoken
by
mexican
and
puerto
rican
settlers
in
hawaii
today
most
people
raised
in
hawaii
can
speak
and
understand
pidgin
to
some
extent

i
have

for
this
person
we
will
probably
stay
in
touch
 
cause
it
was
a
fun
night
it
was
enjoyable
in
the
moment
i
do
not
need
for
it
to
be
anything
else
but
anyway
after
my
little
rant
on
twitter
came
a
tidal
wave
of
fury
like
i
have
never
seen
before
the
last
time
i
got
so
many
replies
was
when
i
dyed
my
hair
pink
which
for
some
reason
made
people
feel
like
they
need
to
let
me
know
what
they
think
of
it
and
if
there
happens
to
be
a
butterfly
and
then
i
came
to
this
senior
photo
taken
in
late
2010
and
posted
by
will
i
can
not
seem
to
get
in
enough
stitching
right
now
every
free
moment
i
am
stitching
away
at
something
i
have
got
2
scarves
done
and
working
on
a
3rd
finished
a
baby
blanket
and
have
completed
3
pairs
of
booties
pictures
will
be
coming
soon
but
here's
an
advanced
sneak
peek
at
some
of
it
entered
for
the
following
challenges
oh
drats
i
just
realized
i
could
add
mark
lipinski
but
i
can
not
find
the
picture
you
will
just
have
to
take
my
word
for
it
he
was
here
for
quilt
canada
in
2010
if
you
have
a
blog
congratulations

personal
and

means
to

the
time
to
list
and
congratulate
the
other
award
winners
so
i
have
been
bad
i
was
supposed
to
write
a
post
but
i
was
once
again
pulled
into
playing
tf2
again
by
some
of
my
crew
i
do
not
even
know
why
they
started
up
again
but
i
guess
it
is
just
something
to
play
for
the
time
being
things
are
seriously
different
now
that
they
have
the
store
and
trading
i
keep
getting
hounded
by
people
just
so
they
can
try
to
collect
hats
one
guy
offered
me
8
weapons
for
me
to
give
him
my
soldiers
helm
that
i
got
for
being
the
one
person
to
actually
buy
worms
reloaded
turned
him
down
if
he
wanted
the
hat
so
bad
he
could
just
go
buy
the
dam
game
himself
dearest
emily
see
here
i
go
and
i
totally
apologize
for
this
rant
i
am
really
sorry
about
this
i
get
annoyed
with
this
topic
because
it
just
seems
like
the
next
thing
oh
what
world
hunger
is
no
longer
important
poverty
isn
t
a
big
deal
they
re
all
connected
but
human
trafficking
is
the
big
thing
going
around
right
now
it
s
like
don
t
you
realize
that
there
are
other
people
struggling
in
this
world
i
just
said
that
all
those
things
are
connected
yes
but
there
s
a
disconnect
in
there
somewhere
too
you
can
purchase
mini
bottles

got
sick
1

instead
this
isn

something
to
hold
against
them
it
s
a
story
repeated
across
the

it

new

yes

is
in

if
nothing
else
i
see
my
blog
as
my
way
of
not
only
sharing
my
love
for
cinema
but
also
nurturing
and
furthering
dialogue
about
the
arts
also
i
do
use
it
to
promote
my
writing
outside
of
the
blog
it
is
my
life
after
all
while
one
may
argue
that
flit
only
did
the
right
thing
in
preparation
for
a
future
conflict
kio
s
story
felt
off
the
tangent
when
compared
with
flit
and
asemu
s
i
mean
both
flit
and
asemu
were
motivated
to
fight
while
kio
was
simply
instructed
by
his
gramps
to
do
so
for
some
reason
it
s
as
if
kio
has
been
treating
this
entire
ordeal
as
a
game
one
that
his
gramps
made
him
play
when
he
was
younger
one
where
he
takes
the
lives
of
human
beings

per
the

of

what
i
love
about
the

is
that
it
has
resisted
turning
its
focus
from
saving
elephants
to
the
subject
that
has
made
it
famous
globally
and
just
in
case
you
are
unaware
this
is
the

jk

found
warmth
and

when

i
re
read
the
houston
speech
this
afternoon
a
lot
of
religious
people
including
a
lot
of
catholics
think
that
jfk
got
it
all
wrong
that
he
did
more
harm
than
good
in
advocating
a
radical
maybe
erroneously
interpreted
separation
of
church
and
state
i
am
really
curious
if
there
were
any
american
catholics
at
the
time
who
disagreed
with
this
speech
and
i
haven
t
been
able
to
find
an
answer
we
got
our
coals
hot
but
not
as
hot
as
you
d
want
for
burgers
or
steak
i
guess
the
best
way
to
achieve
this
is
to
use
less
charcoal
and
spread
it
evenly
on
the
bottom
of
the
grill
after
it
s
hot
we
just
bought
one
of
those
grill
towers
that
speeds
up
the
burning
of
the
coals
and
it
s
proven
to
be
a
good
investment

what
started
out
as
a
simple
case
of
athlete
s
foot
in
me
not
the
dog
no
athletics
required
decided
to
blow
itself
up
almost
literally
into
something
much
worse
it
got
infected
and
turned
my
foot
into
a
painful
red
balloon
squeezing
on
my
boot
was
pathetically
like
an
elephant
trying
to
put
on
cinderella
s
delicate
glass
slipper
i
ve
become
just
a
little
bit
fascinated
over
the
last
few
years
with
the
rise
in
the
number
of
tv
shows
portraying
asperger
s
syndrome
and
the
way
they
are
going
about
it
sometimes
they
get
it
oh
so
right
and
sometimes
they
get
it
oh
so
wrong
so
who
are
your
favourite
aspie
tv
characters
and
which
shows
do
you
think
are
getting
it
right
and
why
boy
weasel
was
a
wiseman
and
when
he
was
up
on
stage
i
told
julio
that
he
was
my
boy
julio
was
impressed
at
how
grown
up
boy
weasel
was
that
is
your
kid
he
has
a
beard
you
are
an
amazing
husband
caring
for
me
as
the
weaker
vessel
pushing
me
towards
christ
likeness
you
are
an
amazing
daddy
constantly
putting
the
needs
of
our
boys
ahead
of
your
own
you
are
their
example
of
what
it
is
to
be
a
godly
man
and
they
are
blessed
to
have
you
you
are
an
amazing
leader
pastoring
our
church
family
humbly
realizing
that
the
job
has
bestowed
on
you
is
nothing
to
take
lightly
but
you
also
lead
with
confidence
because
of
the
one
who
lives
in
you
the
truck
came
on
tuesday
morning
dane
kegan
quinlan
and
my
dad
spent
the
next
several
hours
stacking
cramming
balancing
re
stacking
and
finally
shutting
the
door
on
all
our
earthly
possessions
whew
what
a
day
part
of
the
reason
man
and
woman
s
divinity
is
so
debated
is
because
many
believe
that
we
were
created
under
the
angels
because
of
sloppy
translation
for
instance
in
psalms
8
4
5
which
reads
according
to
the
king
james
version
of
the
bible
laura
you
can
still
put
it
on
your
blog
or
on
facebook
if
you
want
so
how
does
one
go
about
choosing
the
most
appropriate
doctrine
for
their
new
faux
religion
although
various
sorts
of
violence
related
terrorist
acts
continue
in
pakistan
and
these
have
intensified
in
karachi
yet
sectarian
violence
which
is
part
of
the
same
game
also
needs
our
focus
it
is
always
interesting
to
look
back
at
where
you
have
been
and
to
think
about
the
conversations
that
took
place
and
to
ask
why
the
places
that
i
have
been
the
people
that
i
have
conversed
with
the
place
where
i
was
spiritually
it
is
obvious
to
me
that
has
been
speaking
to
me
and
for
once
in
my
life
i
have
actually
been
able
to
hear
him
what
a
great
feeling
it
is
to
be
content
in
reply
to
me
telling
a
friend
of
a
friend
that
from
2013
adopted
children
will
get
the
same
priority
as
looked
after
children
in
the
school
system
that
is
not
fair
why
should
your
daughter
get
priority
over
mine
ummmm
because
she
is
had
a
much
tougher
start
in
life
and
needs
all
the
help
she
can
get
the
first
thing
i
want
to
mention
is
the
simple
space
that
is
available
in
the
dragon
chow
bag
i
have
included
a
picture
of
the
seven
sets
of
dice
that
i
now
have
at
my
disposal
keen
observers
will
notice
that
four
d10s
are
missing
from
the
photo
i
left
them
at
our
gaming
host
s
house
and
i
will
not
get
them
back
until
later
this
week
i
really
thought
about
holding
off
on
taking
the
picture
until
the
weekend
but
i
pushed
through
that
nagging
attention
to
detail
try
any
of
these
fairytale
wedding
favor
ideas
and
you
ll
easily
take
the
princess
crown
as
the
fairest
one
of
all
fundraising
programs
offer
up
a
great
opportunity
for
the
public
to
show
their
support
for
all
different
types
of
causes
this
saturday

another

a
few
weeks
ago
we
had
our
baptism
class
and
by
we
i
mean
me
scott
and
summer
and
julie
ben
and
the
twins
oh
and
i
think
there
maybe
might
have
been
one
other
couple
with
a
little
3
month
old
peanut
there
and
by
class
i
mean
a
get
together
where
we
blew
into
a
stranger
s
house
like
a
tornado
crawled
all
over
their
furniture
stuck
fingers
in
their
vcr
screamed
high
pitched
screams
at
them
for
no
reason
and
ate
all
of
their
food
while
the
other
couple
and
their
little
bebe
sat
quietly
in
the
corner
stunned
and
frozen
as
they
got
a
brief
glance
at
their
near
future
muah
ah
ah
they
looked
scared
the
couple
that
hosted
the
class
was
awesome
had
a
few
grown
children
of
their
own
and
had
a
plan
for
how
the
hour
would
go
a
plan
that
was
blown
to
smithereens
the
moment
we
all
arrived
at
one
point
the
wife
pulled
something
out
of
one
of
the
packets
of
info
we
all
were
given
and
started
i
am
sure
conor
thinks
i
am
nuts
for
making
these
and
he
is
probably
right
but
they
cheered
me
up
anyway
i
got
the
pattern
off
the
wen
website
and
they
are
very
simple
to
make
and
actually
very
comfortable
to
wear
too
basically
wolfmother
is
an
energetic
filled
epic
journey
of

the
album
opens
with
colossal
a
not
so
suggestive
at
all
named
track
which
sets
the
tone
for
the
entire
record
you
know
from
its
first
chords
what
to
expect
and
that
in
my
opinion
is
a
pretty
nice
thing
for
an
album
that
is
not
meant
to
be
taken
seriously
i
like
my
things
neat
and
clear
sweet
memories
from
the
past
where
the
breath
inside
its
be
a
neutral
observer
when
a
situation
occurs
don
t
immediately
judge
it
take
a
deep
breath
and
take
yourself
out
of
it
try
to
see
it
from
multiple
angles
but
that
is
not
all

and
hubby
drove
the
150
mile
round
trip
through
that
snowstorm
to
the
local

center

work
this
morning
the
good
news
was
of
course
that
we
did
not
have
to
drive
the
380
mile
round
trip
to
chop
in
that
same
snowstorm
the
local
trip
can
be
finished
by

starts

the

i

they
were

many
of
these

i
am
always
amazed
at
the
variety

abundance
of
insect
activity
it
attracts
when
blooming
planning
is
the
ability
to
tap
into
the
mind
of
and
gather
the
necessary
details
on
how
the
vision
he
gave
you
will
be
implemented
it
requires
you
to
carefully
do
your
research
so
you
can
effectively
support
and
communicate
the
assumptions
you
make
throughout
the

based
upon
the
revelations
that
the

has
given

if
we

the

ha

good
question
when
i
wrote
the
highland
dancer
the
whole
thing
unfolded
before
my
eyes
like
a
film
and
i
just
wrote
it
down
with
magnus
fin
it
was
mostly
like
that
but
with
a
good
deal
of
re
writing
and
editing
to
knock
it
into
shape
in
addition

for

from

in
order
for
me
to
put

i
had
to

3
months
at
some
point
i
will
take

to
him
later
that

he'd
been
for
a

out
to
the
seaside
with
lara
and
another
couple
he
was
talking
about
how
he'd
sat
on
the
beach
with
them
i
was
really
moved
by
what
he
said
and
within
next
two
years
tremendous

has
been
in

of

consequently
she
has
also
plunged

i
believe
this

is
terrific
and
will
continue
to
be
extremely
successful
however
there
are
two
things
we
need
to
remember
about

i
was
indeed
able
to
do
some
rewrites
on
this
chapter
i
did
not
take
anything
out
i
just
added
a
few
bits
in
here
and
there
i
was
able
to
do
it
yesterday
after
waking
up
at
7am
i
need
to
wake
up
that
early
more
often
i
got
more
done
in
a
few
hours
than
i
have
this
week
anyway
in
this
chapter
we
get
something
that
i
think
we
have
been
lacking
plot
development
oh
boy
we
also
get
some
suave

we
got

the
other
night
i
had
a
dream
that
represents
how
i
feel
about
all
of
this
i
was
driving
along
a
road
that
followed
a
small
river
through
a
beautiful
green
valley
with
farmland
on
either
side
after
following
the
road
for
a
while
i
lost
track
of
what
i
was
doing
and
ended
up
driving
in
a
straight
line
through
a
field
i
was
going
faster
and
faster
and
was
becoming
afraid
because
i
was
straying
so
far
from
the
road
and
i
was
afraid
i
would
get
hurt
just
as
i
was
about
to
wonder
if
i
would
ever
get
back
onto
the
road
i
saw
a
stand
of
tress
up
ahead
that
looked
like
they
might
have
a
path
leading
through
the
stand
back
onto
the
road
i
started
to
relax
and
eventually
reached
the
path
as
i
slowly
made
my
way
through
the
trees
i
saw
a
car
seat
under
a
tree
i
got
out
to
take
a
closer
look
and
found
a
baby
maybe
six
months
old
in
the
seat
uncovered
whimpering
and
shivering
and
almost
dead
i
immediately
picked
the
baby
up
and
held
it
close
covering
it
with
my
coat
and
rubbing
it
gently
to
try
to
get
his
heart
and
blood
warmed
up
eventually
other
people
came
to
help
the
farmer
a
doctor
some
other
drivers
but
i
simply
refused
to
give
the
baby
up
i
was
convinced
that
i
was
doing
the
right
thing
and
that
the
comfort
of
my
arms
and
unconditional
love
i
was
able
to
provide
would
heal
the
baby
quickly
and
thoroughly
in
a
few
more
minutes
the
baby
was
doing
better
the
whimpers
turned
to
coos
and
the
tears
turned
to
small
sniffles
and
then
i
woke
up
knowing
that
the
baby
turned
out
to
be
okay
in
the
end
here's
the
first
sneak
now
let
me
give
you
a
little
background
on
my
friends
house
this
is
a
house
in
which
four
girls
live
they
never
lock
their
garage
they
never
lock
their
back
door
and
they
have
a
lot
of
lawn
furniture
and
two
bicycles
that
sit
unlocked
in
their
unfenced
back
yard
not
to
jink
them
but
these
girls
have
never
had
their
house
broken
into
and
have
never
had
anything
stolen
from
their
back
yard
or
garage
so
i
am
figuring
it
is
a
safe
bet
to
leave
my
bike
in
their
backyard
so
much
so
that
i
do
not
even
lock
up
my
bike
my
fault
for
a
night
changes
will
be
dramatic
giving
the
state
executive
committee
the
power
to
choose
candidates
in
any
and
every
county
anywhere
in
the
entire
state
when
marano
quit
the
party
last
year
he
said
only
mackay
and
another
member
control
the
parties
money
it
took
3
trials
to
convict
john
gotti
it
is
doubtful
if
mackay
will
ever
see
the
inside
of
a
court
room
for
corrupting
the
independence
party
the
city
da's
who
count
on
the
independence
party
and
corrupt
pols
to
get
reelect
will
never
set
up
sting
operations
and
wire
taps
like
the
feds
did
when
that
caught
kruger
boyland
mclaughlin
seminerio
and
many
others
in

feel
the
energy
today
was
a
good
day
actually
we
have
had
mostly
good
days
for
over
a
week
now
they
talk
about
the
nicu
roller
coaster
so
we
are
wondering
when
he
is
going
to
have
a
down
day
again
for
me
a
planner
this
is
one
of
the
toughest
things
about
the
nicu
not
knowing
what
is
going
to
happen
tomorrow
much
less
weeks
from
now
for
now
his
doctors
seem
pleased
with
his
progress
there
are
two
big
general
areas
of
concern
for
most
preemies
at
this
age
respiration
and
feeding
nutrition
we
get
daily
updates
from
the
nurses
and
his
doctor
regarding
his
progress
what
they'd
like
to
see
happening
next
and
what
is
coming
up
with
his
care
earlier
this
week
i
painted
an
antique
refrigerator
brooke
rescued
this
refrigerator
before
it
was
headed
to
the
goodwill
pile
from
her
in
laws
so
it
was
a
family
piece
and
she
had
a
vision
we
used
inspiration
from
the
restoration
hardware
catalog
and
i
really
kind
of
just
played
with
washes
and
finishes
until
we
came
to
a
place
that
felt
right
for
the
piece
i
wish
you
guys
could
see
the
rest
of
the
room
that
this
piece
is
now
in
it
is
really
beautiful
brooke
has
great
taste
and
i
can
not
wait
to
show
you
the
piece
once
she
has
it
all
decorated

it
is
a
long
way
to
the
top
ac
dc
since
i
do
not
have
the
time
or
energy
to
download
photos
to
catch
up
on
what
is
been
going
on
the
past
few
weekends
i
thought
i
would
just
focus
on
me
for
a
moment
what
is
going
on
with
me
the
wiry
officer
pulled
a
plastic
bag
out
of
his
pants
pocket
and
approached
the
gun
he
faltered
and
let
out
a
little
shriek
when
the
stone
burst
and
flew
right
at
his
face
what
the
jackson
reached
for
his
own
gun
i
guess
it
was
meant
to
be
flattering
i
guess
it
was
meant
to
portray
me
as
tough
but
even
if
you
re
tough
enough
to
start
your
day
with
a
meal
of
deadly
poisonous
insects
it
s
not
something
you
particularly
want
to
do
you
don
t
seek
it
out
you
do
it
because
there
s
no
other
honorable
option

friendly
and

and
in
a
large
part
because
of
this
blog
my
writing
is
getting
better
at
least
that
s
what
i
like
to
think
over
the
last
year
i
ve
experimented
with
a
bunch
of
new
techniques
and
styles
from
comedy
in
the
yellow
brick
road
to
gothic
suspense
in
the
chamber
i
had
fun
speculating
on
canon
scenes
in
what
sarah
said
and
dead
in
the
woods
i
even
got
to
make
federico

a
lorca
a
vampire
in

in

and
have
pam
and
sookie
come
visit
me
in
my
home
sweet
home
story
the

i
m
still
surprised
by
how
popular
the
extra
true
blood
scene
the
kiss
has
been
i
d
do
each
one
of
these
stories
a
little
differently
now
but
they
were
all
a
ton
of
fun
and
great
writing
experience
in
one
way
or
another
the
red
bus
takes
you
around
the
city
it
is
a
hop
on
hop
off
set
up
and
comes
around
to
the
stops
every
15
minutes
it
is
a
very
cool
way
to
see
the
city
because
the
top
level
of
the
bus
has
no
roof
so
i
do
suggest
a
hat
and
sunblock
on
sunny
days
we
had
some
great
down
time
say
uncle
is
an
expression
here
in
the
us
used
when
two
people
are
fighting
and
the
person
with
the
upper
hand
is
trying
to
get
the
other
one
to
concede
defeat
by
saying
uncle
jaws
as
one
of
the
male
characters
begins
his
diatribe
about
how
americans
ideas
of
relaxing
are
working
themselves
to
the
bone
all

just
so
they
can
lay
around
in
their
pajamas
on
weekends
drink
six
packs
of
miller
light
and
watch
other
people
live
their
lives
on

he
presents
to
the
audience
the
concept
of
la
dolce
far

or
the
sweetness
of
doing
nothing
once
henry
viii
came
to
the
throne
the
codpiece
became
an
art
form
it
was
exaggerated
to
amazing
proportions
it
was
often
stuffed
with
a
padding
called
bombast
a
word
now
used
to
mean
pompous
and
pretentious
it
was
puffed
and
and
slashed
and
sometimes
heavily
ornamented
it
became
so
large
that
it
was
often
used
to
conceal
a
weapon
or
to
hide
jewels
hence
a
man
s
genitalia
being
known
as
the
family
jewels
armour
at
this
time
followed
the
fashion
and
metal
codpieces
were
added
to
the
best
full
harnesses
come
on
lane
couldn
t
close
a
car
door
a
smooth
civilised
track
gave
us
false
hopes
about
how
easy
it
would
be
to
climb
the
mountain
we
soon
realised
that
to
get
to
the
top
would
require
ascending
a
rocky
between
two
large
outcops
of
granite
the
climb
was
well
worth
it
and
we
spent
a
good
hour
or
more
surveying
the
landscape
and
trying
to
work
out
which
mountain
was
which
before
climbing
down
and
heading
home
the
long
passed
charlemagne
would
never
have
allowed
a
claim
of
royal
title
ahead
of
a
throneless
heart
of
the
eu
european
empire
and
probably
led
to
this
inspired
backlash
doubtless
the
greatest
among
that
era
would
not
tolerate
a
smaller
area
led
by
one
of
his
distant
scions
to
attack
germany
how
could
they
claim
sovereignty
over
what
that
one
still
considers
sovereign

wouldn

if
we
could

to

the

and

that
we
all
feel
for
our
daughters
what
kind
of
women
would
we
be
and
what
kind
women
would
we
raise
they
are
important
questions
worth
considering
happy
day
to
all
you
mom
s
out
there
and
honestly
so
many
of
those
exciting
things
get
buried
in
all
that
waiting
and
writing
that
i
often
tend
to
forget
them
and
what
they
were
like
keeping
a
journal
with
lots
of
exclamation
points
is
helpful
i
think
the
biggest
highlight
for
me
is
getting
my
book
delivered
to
me
and
i
finally
get
to
hold
it
touch
it
read
it
for
me
then
it
is
real
i
do
not
think
i'd
fare
well
with
ebook
only
it
is
so
intangible
so
getting
my
physical
book
is
probably
one
of
the
most
exciting
things
even
more
than
release
day
getting
my
final
cover
is
also
very
exciting
and
memorable
geneva
in
switzerland
is
worth
a
visit

can

don

joined
us
this
weekend
as
they
often
do
we
do
not
get
to
spend
much
time
with
them
so
it
was
nice
to
have
them
along
the
boys
are
crazy
about
them
and
they
were
a
huge
help
to
us
they
took
the
boys
hiking
on
saturday
so
that
scott
i
and
his
niece
could
bike
the
virginia

trail
we
had
taken
the
boys
on
the
trail
on
friday
and
they
did
well
but
certainly
were
not
up
for
it
two
days
in
a

we
really
want
to
hear
from
our

try
using
the

so
i
used
the
little
butterflies
instead
of
brads
i
added
some
sparkle
to
my
butterflies
and
to
the
dots
on
the
olive
circle
because
i
just
can
not
make
a
card
without
adding
some
sort
of
sparkle

the

was
layered
because
i
did
not
like
the
look
of
either
of

institute
at
byu
bonnie
ballif
spanvill
and
valerie

were
just
getting
the

database
under

in

the
database
documents
of
women's
rights
and
women's
social
political
and
family
situations
in
every
country
in
the
world
with
the
data
base
they
were
hoping
that
they
would
be
able
to
show
that
the
economic
and
political
stability
and
growth
of
a
country
was
directly
related
to
how
well
women
were
treated
and
valued
which
is
exactly
what
they
found
the
implications
of
their
findings
is
enormous
and
i
can
not
wait
to
see
what
else
comes
out
of
this
hopefully
towards
creating
a
better
world
for
women
and
one
in
which
the
perpetuation
of
life
and
those
who
create
it
is
more
highly
valued

their

are

wants

to

them
with

cutter
because
that
s
efficient
oh
and
gordon
says
the
burgers
are
bland
and
need
to
be

gives
max
another

this

though
that

so
i
had
to
get

in

my

you
trick
me
into
saying
duh
to
you
then
it

i
say
duh

i
didn

mean
it
and
i
m
not

how

it
shows

have
to
select
where
i
place
my

into

won

the
how
of
the

like
the
nature
of
the

is
ultimately
a
mystery
and
yet
the
holy

and
the
holy

help
us
to
approach
this
mystery
they
enable
us
to
understand

there

bh
in

he
is
the
father
figure
in

who
i

absolutely

her
to

upon
he
is

patient
funny
loves
nature
smart
dependable
loving
and
just
a
good
good
person
now
that
he
is
my
partner
in
raising
this
headstrong
girly
girl
i
have
no
concept
of
how
i
would
ever
be
able
to
do
it
without
him
he
helps
me
not
only
in
practical
ways
but
also
in
helping
me
see
things
through
his
wise
eyes
he
talks
me
through
my
daily
parenting
frustrations
and
the
geej
she
is
absolutely
crazy
about
him
she
calls
him
by
his
first
name
when
she
is
talking
to
him

when
she
is
talking
about
him

instead
of

feeling

i
thought
what
a
waste
the
first
time
that
i
saw
you
the
other
women
and
i
checked
on
the
almost
victim
she
was
ok
no
harm
done
just
a
bit
shaken
but
it
got
me
to
thinking
could've
been
me
why
was
not
it
the
ancient
rabbis
traditional
judaism
s
most
authoritative
sources
almost
always
interpreted
isaiah

with
reference
to
an
individual
rather
than
to
israel
as
a
whole
or
to
the
righteous
within
israel
and
this
individual
was
most
commonly
interpreted
to
the
messiah

this

made

experiences

don

sure
it
is

of

nick
and
i
have
been
doing
so
much
talking
lately
my
mother
passed
away
from
cancer
when
i
was
5
i
had
5
or
6
au
pairs
in
about
3
years
my
dad
re
married
twice
i
became
a
little
mom
of
my
two
younger
sisters
whether
my
dad
needed
the
help
or
not
and
they
were
not
impressed
with
me
i
missed
out
on
a
lot
at
school
because
i
had
to
come
home
and
babysit
and
get
dinner
ready
i
could
easily
have
developed
any
of
a
variety
of
social
or
mental
health
issues
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
i
was
in
and
out
of
counselors
offices
my
entire
childhood
my
father
knew
it
was
out
of
his
scope
and
got
me
help
as
much
as
my
friend
is
doing
for
her
child
what
s
the
difference
i
am
not
sure
i
have
an
answer
i
had
the
support
of
my
dad
and
an
amazing
extended
family
that
included
actual
family
great
neighbors
and
a
few
close
friends
maybe
i
do
still
have
some
problems
since
i
never
ask
for
help
and
truly
don
t
know
if
i
can
i
am
the
fixer
and
have
no
idea
how
to
let
others
help
it
tends
to
make
my
husband
frustrated
and
angry
because
he
can
see
i
need
help
but
he
keeps
hoping
i
will
ask
i
also
don
t
open
up
about
my
thoughts
or
feelings
i
am
a
pretty
introverted
person
and
opening
up
is
hard
to
do
i
can
see
where
that
would
be
really
difficult
for
the
person
on
the
other
end
of
a
conversation
we
all
need
oasis's
in
our
life
i
m
sorry
to
be
a
tease
but
i
have
to
go
to
bed
i
promise
you
ll
have
the
third
and
final
chapter
of
the
red
car
boy
story
before
the
end
of
the
week
i
also
need
to
update
you
on
my
potential
dates
i
ve
got
one
booked
in
for
this
thursday
night
come
on
down

number
five
with
the
ocker
guy
that
i
ve
mentioned
previously
sparkly
eye
guy
from
the
same
post
has
also
been
calling
and
messaging
and
i
m
kinda
into
the
idea
of
him
i
was
also
able
to
stalk
his
facebook
and
found
that
he
takes
amazing
photos
which
kinda
sorta
makes
me
a
bit
swoony
during
a
party
scene
we
have
a
black
female
character
playing
a
french
baronesse
and
society
lady
absolutely
nothing
is
made
of
her
skin
colour
and
she
fits
neatly
into
the
dinner
table
round
while
this
may
no
longer
raise
an
eyebrow
it
is
remarkable
for
a
film
of
its
time
originally
i
wanted
to
be
an
astronaut
then
i
found
out
it
wasn
t
the
astronauts
that
got
to
design
the
spacecraft

helps
to
enjoy
what
you
re
doing
well
mr
king
you
certainly
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
considering
that
it
was
you
that
allowed
our
ex
pm
gordon
brown
to
empty
the
gold
bullion
out
of
the
vaults
of
the
bank
of
england
and
send
it
over
to
the
eu
troy
crowder
and
i
know
this
may
sound
strange
coming
from
someone
who
follows
the
wiccan
faith
but
the
words
are
strong
in
their
potential
and
carry
their
own
weight
no
matter
who
speaks
them
the
picture
is
from
the
kids
first
school
dance
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
and
here's
my
crazy
beans
she
had
a
blast
at
the
dance
can
not
you
tell
in
post

europe
the
publication
and
appeal
of
the
protocols
dwindled
lavette
s
takes
on
familiar
songs
were
far
from
simple
nods
to
classic
rock
the
arrangements
were
dark
sparse
deliberate
slow
and
they
basically
left
the
performers
and
the
audience
nowhere
to
hide
from
the
raw
emotion
of
each
song
this
type
of
expression
is
rare
and
as
satisfying
as
it
gets
to
watch
but
it
is
draining
too
extract
from
the
book
georgia
o'keeffe
an
eternal
spirit
there
is
no
one
who
is
more
in
you
corner
we
will
look
back
on
this
week
and
realize
that
something
changed
i
have
given
numerous
interviews
wherein
i
espoused
the
benefits
of
thorough
vetting
during
aggressive
contested
primary
elections
but
this
week
s
tactics
aren
t
what
i
meant
those
who
claim
allegiance
to
ronald
reagan
s
11th
commandment
should
stop
and
think
about
where
we
are
today
ronald
reagan
and
barry
goldwater
the
fathers
of
the
modern
conservative
movement
would
be
ashamed
of
us
in
this
primary
let
me
make
clear
that
i
have
no
problem
with
the
routine
rough
and
tumble
of
a
heated
campaign
as
i
said
at
the
first
tea
party
convention
two
years
ago
i
am
in
favor
of
contested
primaries
and
healthy
pointed
debate
they
help
focus
candidates
and
the
electorate
i
have
fought
in
tough
and
heated
contested
primaries
myself
but
what
we
have
seen
in
florida
this
week
is
beyond
the
pale
it
was
unprecedented
in
gop
primaries
i
ve
seen
it
before
heck
i
lived
it
before
but
not
in
a
gop

this

looks
sichuanese

i

comments
this
is
a
surprisingly
light
ipa
that
seems
to
fit
all
summer
season
because
it
lacks
the
aggressive
characteristics
hop
flavors
that
normally
make
this
a
cool
weather
beer
should
you
be
invited
to
a
beach
party
this
summer
it
would
do
you
no
harm
to
take
a
case
of
the
spear
along
the
matter
what
food
is
served
i
feel
it
is
one
of
the
most
refreshing
ipas
i
have
ever
tasted
below
is
our
upcoming
schedule
for
the
next
several
sundays
at
the
coffee
haven
in

if
you
are
a

interested
in

at
an
upcoming

please
check

did
not
eat
the
eggs
but
ate
the
gim
faces
and
she
also
left
most
of
the
broccoli
no
reason
given
and
she
did
not
want
to
eat
any
of
it
later
on
i
think
it
was
just
the
day
as
she
really
did
not
eat
much
at
dinner
time
so
i
am
guessing
just
a
not
all
that
hungry
day
while
i
was
outside
taking
pictures
a
ups
truck
started
to
lumber
up
our
driveway
tara
and
madeline
screamed
and
ran
into
the
woods
so
he
would
not
see
how
hideous
they
looked
silly
girls
i
am
also
thankful
that
during
the
month
of
november
i
found
plenty
of
things
to
be
thankful
for
yes
i
truly
am
blessed
with
family
friends
and
plenty
of
other
blessings
i
am
so
glad
i
took
this
month
to
reflect
on
so
many
of
them

our
lord
s
attitude
toward
this
man
was
one
of
severe
discouragement
for
he
knew
what
was
in
man
john

we
would
have
said
i
can
t
imagine
why
he
lost
the
opportunity
of
winning
that
man
imagine
being
so
cold
to
him
and
turning
him
away
so
discouraged
never
apologize
for
your
lord
the
words
of
the
lord
hurt
and
offend
until
there
is
nothing
left
to
be
hurt
or
offended
jesus
christ
had
no
tenderness
whatsoever
toward
anything
that
was
ultimately
going
to
ruin
a
person
in
his
service
to
our
lord
s
answers
were
not
based
on
some
whim
or
impulsive
thought
but
on
the
knowledge
of
what
was
in
man
if
the
spirit
of
brings
to
your
mind
a
word
of
the
lord
that
hurts
you
you
can
be
sure
that
there
is
something
in
you
that
he
wants
to
hurt
to
the
point
of
its
death
we
have
also
been
super
busy
with
school
dance
and
friends
you
know
the
usual
i
like
keeping
busy
but
i'd
like
a
break
every
now
again
too
the
trouble
is
i
know
a
lot
more
about
romney
than
he
is
telling
me
in
this
speech
how
evil
nasty
is
the
enemy
very
evil
because
no
one
knew
it
was
there
no
one
could
tell
when
it
was
laying
the
foundation
for
its
demonic
plans
then
adding
all
the
layers
like
icing
on
a
cake
ever
since
then
i
ve
been
very
interested
in
style
especially
when
i
feel
insecure
or
inadequate
and
need
a
confidence
boost
so
if
i
ve
got
a
big
meeting
or
complex
situation
i
think
carefully
about
what
i
m
going
to
wear
indeed
if
i
look
back
on
my
life
over
the
last
decade
or
so
whenever
there
has
been
a
really
big
issue
on
the
horizon
or
new
job
that
i
don
t
feel
quite
up
to
or
a
complex
situation
that
i
feel
is
beyond
me
i
have
often
taken
refuge
in
clothing
appropriate
to
that
context
i
figure
if
you
don
t
know
quite
what
you
are
doing
if
you
at
least
look
like
you
do
or
look
the
part
or
look
like
belong
you
might
just
be
able
to
hide
behind
the
outfit
and
people
may
not
see
the
kid
nearly
paralysed
by
stage
fright
they
might
instead
see
the
character
that
you
are
playing
most
importantly
you
might
just
find
that
you
feel
differently
just
a
wee
bit
less
lacking
in
confidence
when
you
are
appropriately
attired
after
i
hung
up
the
phone
i
turned
to
my
blog
list
near
the
top
was
a
friend's

i
had

so
of
course
i
followed
the

and
i
read
our
story
a
family
interested
in
waiting
children
the
mom
who
is
off
her
rocker
and
the
dad
who
was
skeptical
about
adding
more
than
one
child
at
a
time
two
interested
families
one
of
whom
was
running
into
difficulties
due
to
finances
and
the
kids
at
home
and
the
other
who
did
not
have
as
many
obstacles
to
overcome
if
this
wasn
t
a
confirmation
from
that
we
were
supposed
to
bring
this
boy
home
i
can
t
think
of
anything
else

of

but
tonight
as
i
was
talking
about
the
day
with
the
girls
sofie
said
the
absolute
best
part
was
climbing
trees
with
her
friends
it
was
all
part
of
practicing
for
being
firemen
when
they
are
grown
up
apparently
she
bullies
the
bugs
to
no
end
and
to
bugsy's
dismay
she
enjoys
making
friends
human
and
canine
you
may
remember
that
bugsy
hates
everyone
violet
is
the
exact
opposite
she
loves
nearly
everyone
but
be
careful
she
is
very
aggressive
with
her
love
her
kisses
land
right
on
the
lips
every
time
no
matter
how
you
try
to
maneuver
her
it
is
a
gift
lessee
what
else
did
i
do
oh
yeah
i
helped
patti
take
all
the
food
off
the
shelves
and
move
them
followed
by
cleaning
up
under
and
behind
them
it
was
not
purty
i
tell
you
what
and
then
restocked
the
shelves
minus
a
few
cans
of
stuff
that
expired
a
long
time
ago

according
to

whose

above
it
is
interesting
to
note
the

growth
of
issuing
patents
with
titles
containing
terms
like

and
 
software
 
that
predates

this
would
seem
to
disprove
the
notion
common
amongst
opponents
of
software
patents
that
state
street
led
to
a
flood
of
software
related
patent
filings
rather
it
looks
very

the

that

she
never
spoke
to
me
in
words
her
expression
was
one
of
contained
joy
waiting
to
share
something
with
me
once
again
i
felt
myself
becoming
nervous
not
knowing
what
to
do
or
say
i
was
literally
dumbfounded
what
could
or
should
i
say
to
this
amazing
being
i
stood
there
like
a
child
after
a
moment
she
widened
her
expressive
eyes
as
if
in
an
inquiry
i
felt
even
more
at
a
loss
as
if
i
had
failed
a
test
of
understanding
something
she
was
trying
to
get
me
to
see
i
smiled
and
tried
to
show
that
i
did
not
know
what
she
was
expecting
from
me
her
smile
widened
some
more
and
then
she
opened
her
hand
and
showed
me
something
lying
there
it
was
a
coin
on
the
plane
ride
here
three

they
thought
they
were
terribly
clever
one
of
them
said
if
i
ever
got
a
girlfriend
i
would
trap
her
and
her
like
silence
of
the
lambs
i
looked
at
them
i
did
not
want
to
look
at
them
and
i
felt
they
were
performing
for
me
i
felt
their
open
mouths
was
causing
my
mouth
to
stay
closed
because
of
the
symposium
i
was
going
to
speak
at
and
participate
at
i
thought
about
the
effects
of
such
violence
the
effects
of
such
silencing
during
the
war
the
tavern
was
taken
over
by
loyalists
charles
loosely
and
thomas
elms
and
was
called
the
kings
head
until
1780
when
it
became
brooklyn
hall
loyalists
and
british
soldiers
who
occupied
new
york
were
said
to
have
fun
here
engaging
in
all
kinds
of
sporting
such
as
horse
racing
fox
chasing
athletic
sports
bull
baiting
etc
it
s
a
glowing
vibrant
grand
world
of
adventure
violence
tenderness
good
humor
great
friendship
and
a
prevailing
love
bound
by
blood
above
all
it
is
a
distinctly
human
world
in
which
important
only
in
an
abstract
sense
proves
fairly
useless
when
stavro
laments
that
may
have
erred
in
preserving
a
few
of
his
subjects
after
the
flood
he
adds
forgivingly
that
it
wasn
t
entirely
s
fault
since
like
me
at
sixteen
didn
t
know
the
world
all
that
well
and
didn
t
know
what
people
were
capable
of
doing

a
spokesman
for
the
local

an

network
said
security
forces
simultaneously
stormed
several
districts
in
the

of

including
the
bab
dreib
bab
houd
and
the

neighborhoods
nine
people
were
confirmed
dead
in
ongoing
shooting
in
those
areas
the
lcc
said
because
these
core
historical
facts
have
been
established
by
critical
and
historical
procedures
no
one
should
reject
this
evidence
simply
by
referring
to
discrepancies
in
the
new
testament
or
to
its
general
unreliability
these
facts
are
attested
to
be
true
by
virtually
everyone
it
can
be
demonstrated
even
when
the
minimum
number
of
historical
facts
are
utilized
steele
stands
ready
to
paint
with
a
broad
brush
those
white
people
who
deviate
from
this
neutral
or
might
one
say
neutered
stance
as
white
supremacists
the
european
imperialist
who
reached
across
the
seas
and
colonized
foreign
lands
demonstrated
his
white
supremacist
hubris
and
the
whites
who
today
strive
to
preserve
the
racial
and
cultural
uniqueness
of
his
group
according
to
steele
demonstrates
the
same
white
supremacist
tendencies
whites

not
possess
the

with
a
mix
of
frustration

this
is
the
answer
i
looked
for
all

the

i
want
everything
else
the

the
cleaning
the

the
duties
to
fall
away
and
leave
me
dozens
of
hours
to
disappear
into
finishing
this
story
it
s
frustrating
because
the
timing
is
off
i
budget
time
for
fiction
but
today
s
hours
were
allotted
to
getting
grades
entered
and
i
m
being
bratty
to
complain
about
it
i
m
lucky
enough
to
be
working
only
part
time
this

to
have
3

off
for

this

likewise

says
it
s
important
to
play
to
win
in
business
that
translates
to
knowing
the
competition
and
always
staying
at

one
step
ahead
operate
your
business
with

and
have
respect
for

you
also
need
to
seize

to

i
was
out

dinner
with

we
sat
outside
at

and
an

played
soft

the
owner
of
the
restaurant
a
tall

man
with
a

i
couldn

quite
believe
was
real
danced
with
his
wife
on
the
little
brick
patio
and
his
loose
light
stepping
made
my
throat
tighten
he
danced
like
my
dad
controlled
but
free
fluid
and
graceful
and
lithe
i
longed
to
ask
him
to
dance
with
me
he
may
very
well
have
but
i
was
more
afraid
that
were
we
to
dance
i
would
lay
my
head
on
his
shoulder

active
media
consumption
is
the
emerging
model
for
media
consumption
where
we
have
to
make
our
choices
without
someone
providing
our
options
to
us
music
is
just
one
example
netflix
uses
this
model
for
television
and
movie
consumption
to
a
certain
extent
amazon
has
done
the
same
for
books
even
traditional
broadcasting
companies
are
jumping
on
board
by
allowing
you
to
watch
new
episodes
of
many
shows
online
or
through
an
ipad
app
almost
immediately
after
they
first
air
we
re
still
in
transition
to
this
new
media
model
but
you
can
clearly
see
it
happening
every
year
for
those
of
you
who
are
not
aussie
it
is
footy
grand
finals
time
this
weekend
by
saying
footy
i
do
not
mean
soccer
i
am
referring
to
aussie
rules
and
rugby
league
and
this
time
every
year
we
are
inundated
with
footy
flashbacks
awards
nights
final
fever
and
many
many
bbq's
will
be
held
this
weekend
across
australia
to
watch
these
games
so
in
the
spirit
of
footy
this
weeks
challenge
at
the

the
fox
is
make
it
sporty
i
know
what
this
thing
is
my
question
is
will
this
put

someone
who
is
not
only
a

playing

in
a
titanic
battle
of
wills
between
my
lovely

my

darth

since
last

several

for
both
a

several

fell
through
for

of
reason
you
might
be
able
to
guess
as

went
on
though
the
main
issue
became
how
dragonwife
and
i
wanted
to
go
slow
and
look
around
for
the
right
car
figuring
we
could
juggle
the
duties
of
driving
him
to
and
from
work
with
the
vehicles
we
already
own
however
the

crazed

wanted
something
bought
immediately
and
became
increasingly
aggravated
with
what
he
saw
was
our
glacial

the
last
time
it
was
at
this
level
was
in
march
2002
and
academic
gentlemen
this
was
so
delicious
especially
since
it
was
cauliflower
which
i
detest
serve
alongside
the
ribs
and
this
is
the
meal
of
champions
this
meal
is
a
little
time
consuming
but
so
worth
it
for
busy
people
it
would
probably
be
best
to
make
this
on
the
weekend
also
for
the
record
that
looks
like
a
lot
of
ribs
but
there
was
more
fat
on
that
piece
than
meat
it
was
still
marvelous
though
perhaps
the
only
thing
that
could
have
made
these
better
would
have
been
if

used

the
first
round
of
the
presidential
election
is
just
three
weeks
away
despite
the
violence
and
the
disqualification
of
several
leading
candidates
at
the
moment
the
vote
does
not
appear
to
be
under
threat
abi
a
half
an
hour
later
i
took
him
to
the
emergency
room
there
they
took
a
sample
from
his
diaper
and
sent
it
off
to
the
lab
7
days
later
it
came
back
negative
seriously
by
this
point
he
was
on
a
ventilator
and
had
already
had
his
so
i
have
no
idea
how
it
came
back
negative
that
is
crazy
in
my
opinion
but
i
am
not
a
doctor
so
what
do
i
know
right
when
i
began
thinking
about
how
i
got
my
agent
the
savvy
and
sweet
michael
bourret
with
dystel
goderich
i
realized
there
were
a
series
of
steps
that
led
me
to
that
thrilling
moment
because
for
most
people
i
know
owning
a
house
will
no
doubt
remain
a
fantasy
it
s
something
that
s
become
clear
over
the
past
few
years
that
those
of
us
who
live
in
cities
whose
jobs
are
not
secure
who
are
flitting
from
call
centre
to
job
centre
and
back
again
throughout
our
20s
and
30s
whose
parents
don
t
have
property
portfolios
those
of
us
who
are
single
or
still
trying
to
do
art
or
music
or
something
they
dreamed
of
are
unlikely
to
be
able
to
afford
the
deposit
for
a
flat
ever
which
would
be
fine
especially
fine
when
the
bath
fills
with
soupy
rust
coloured
water
or
the
smell
from
the
downstairs
chicken
shop
actually
stops
you
in
your
tracks
when
you
walk
through
the
door
even
though
they
promise
their

think
that
nowadays
people
like
to
correct
to
just
show
that
they
are
better
than
others
the
lord
really
used
samuel
when
it
came
to
saul
and
his
actions
saul
was
disobeying
the
lord
in
every
way
possible
he
was
defiant
and
went
against
the
lord
s
orders
when
samuel
went
to
rebuke
saul
in
chapter
13
samuel
went
low
to
correct
him
with
love
he
didn
t
become
big
headed
about
it
he
didn
t
use
the
opportunity
to
show
how
much
better
he
was
than
saul
i
think
this
is
really
important
to
keep
in
mind
when
we
correct
people
we
need
to
go
low
and
humble
ourselves
we
need
to
encourage
and
then
correct
and
then
encourage
we
need
to
go
about
it
in
love
everyone
makes
mistakes
if
we
correct
in
love
then
people
are
more
likely
to
correct
their
actions
and
react
to
your
correction
with
love
this
is
an
important
part
of
our
walk
with
christ
jesus
went
out
of
love
in
all
his
corrections
we
need
to
hold
ourselves
to
that
same
standard
time
for
a
little
bit
of
five
question
friday
y'all
today
is
the
unofficial
first
day
of
spring
break
for
us
in
this
county
the
school
board
actually
planned
a
teacher
workday
the
friday
before
spring
break
week
starts
so
we
are
starting
today
by
having
little
e
miss
today
since
his
vpk
does
not
follow
school
teacher
workdays
i
do
not
have
much
fun
stuff
planned
for
the
kids
today
tho
since
the
hubs
is
working
miss
k
and
i
are
planning
on
pedicures
though
maybe
little
e
can
stand
it
long
enough
while
watching
the
ipad
let's
hope
so
on
the
sixth
day
of
my
trip
i
visited
a
retired
schoolmarm
in
a
town
called
serendipity
she
wants
to
write
them
dime
novels
too
i
told
her
my
5
favorite
places
to
write
miss
viv
liked
my
books
so
much
that
she
rushed
out
to
the
local
stationer
bought
a
passel
of
em
not
my
dime
novel
i
hasten
to
add
my
writers
notebooks
as
it
is
now
it
is
a
big
shame
and
with
a
blog
title
like
that
how
can
you
not
want
to
go
visit
i
love
it
she
is
as
sweet
as
the
title
of
her
blog
and
i
fell
in
love
with
her
blog
at
first
bloggy
sight
she
is
hilarious
and
i
simply
cannot
get
enough
of
her
posts
whether
they
are
about
how
aliens
have
obviously
been
enrolled
in
her
third
grade
class
instead
of
actual
human
third
graders
or
her
lists
of
why
things
happen
i
get
lost
in
her
posts
and
hate
to
have
to
walk
away
to
actually
do
some
house
work
do
yourself
a
favor
and
go
check
her
out
you
have
a
lot
of
hilarious
catching
up
to
do
senior
lecturer
university
of
brighton
but
there
is
one
issue
with
him
should
have
closed
the
windows
love
i
first
picked
up
edge
in
a
bookstore
because
of
the
unique
cover
treatment
there
was
an
end
dump
with
books
from
angry
robot
a
press
i
had
not
heard
of
and
this
one
had
a
cover
design
that
was
nearly
all
words
so
much
so
that
the
title
is
a
little
difficult
to
distinguish
the
title
the
cover
described
what
can
only
be
described
as
a
running
man
type
scenario
with
knife
fights
and
sudden
death
on
saturday
afternoon
we
visited
this
place
which
was
quite
fun
and
put
me
in
a
mind
of
an
analogy
if
schlitterbahn
was
a
golf
course
waterworks
would
be
its
putt
putt
course
similarly
designed
much
smaller
also
less
than
5
minutes
from
pod's
parent's
house
the
kids
loved
it
and
even
i
was
talked
into
riding
the
giant
water
slide
once
up
the
ladder
and
down
the
wall
3
tbsp
canola
or
veg
oil
only
300c
what
do
you
think
i
m
doing
i
m
having
fun
with
the
stripper
you
got
me
for
my
birthday
since
when
was
ricky
all
prim
and
proper
after
all
this
was
his
idiotic
idea
his
protestations
of
eroding
malay
privileges
ring
hollow
at
this
time
and
doesn
t
to
the
young
either
maybe
he
finds
the
ears
of
the
fatcats
who
fear
the
erosion
of
their
ill
gotten
crony
laced
income
and
traditional
power
base
just
because
mario's
bar
and
grill
has
a
shamrock
in
the
window
it
does
not
necessarily
make
it
an
irish
bar
food
intake
no
5
4pm
hope
you
are
as
excited
as
me
that
tomorrow
is
friday
for
the
record
i
do
not
really
think
it
tastes
anything
like
tuna
but
its
delicious
in
its
own
right
in
a
separate
bowl
beat
the
sour
cream
with
the
eggs
and
vanilla
essence
add
to
the
saucepan
and
mix
in
so
holding
the
snow's
hand
she
let
it
twirl
her
gracefully
gliding
over
the
dance
floor
a
long
and
breathless
pirouette
right
into
the
oncoming
lane
across
to
the
further
curb
which
we
struck
not
fast
but
hard
so
that
our
bones
rang
with
it
the
truck
thought
about
rolling
over
but
decided
not
to
and
dropped
back
to
all
four
paws
with
a
thump
as
you
know
korin
and
i
are
expecting
another
baby
the
due
date
is
mid
may
so
let
s
call
it
may
15th
just
for
fun
i
thought
we
would
have
people
try
to
guess
when
the
new
baby
will
actually
get
here
the
closest
guess
can
have
a
merrymeeting
t
shirt
sizes
and
colors
are
getting
a
little
limited
but
i
am
sure
we
can
make
something
work
brown

after
about
twenty
minutes
on
the
bike
my
body
is
in
a
full
sweat
a
cleansing
sweat
if
my
legs
are
going
too
fast
it
means
the
resistance
level
is
too
easy
i
need
to
crank
it
up
i
need
to
feel
just
a
bit
of
burn
if
does
not
take
some
mental
effort
it
is
not
worth
it
it
is
not
making
me
strong
i
think
about
the
rhythm
of
the
song
in
my
ears
i
match
the
up
and
down
of
my
legs
with
the
beat
of
the
music
the
funny
thing
is
that
that
city
is
an
ancient
one
its
modern
buildings
standing
on
the
ruins
of
a
3000
year
old
civilization
and
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
fairly
young
buenos
aires
unanswered
questions
apologies
i
have
been
unwell
for
a
week
but
feeling
better
now
apparently
it
is
easter
this
weekend
which
means
it
is
the
annual
cr
me
egg
festival
at
chez
blue
this
is
a
private
occasion
but
this
brief
clip
should
give
you
a
clue
as
to
what
will
be
going
on
so
that
was
our
first
day
of
school
who
is
up
for
round
two
take
my
hand
i
won
t
let
you
fall
and
yet
to
end
the
day
a
day
of
reflection
and
honor
joy
in
beauty
we
stopped
in
at
a
cute
little
brand
new
mexican
restaurant
called
mi
casa
in
benson
the
food
was
fabulous
and
i
highly
recommend
it
i
will
certainly
be
stopping
there
anytime
i
go
that
direction
whether
for
future
trips
to
bisbee
or
on
the
upcoming
trip
down
to
the
chirachua
national
monument
upon
releasing
the
new
single
album
infinite
is
also
conducting
several
promotional
events
in
japan
starting
on
april
25
infinite
will
visit
tokyo
osaka
and
fukuoka
for
album
promotion
and
fan
meeting
events
whimsical
dreams
of
rolling
down
the
hillside
any
questions
beauty
advice
from
a
supermodel
together
enough
the
beer
was
so
popular
that
the
boss
offered
to
buy
the
ingredients
next
year
so
next
year
i
will
brew
a
christmas
beer
for
me
and
one
for
the
office
it
began
oh
so
innocently
a
mew
a
purr
and
suddenly
i
was
in
petsmart
buying
a
fancy
new
automatic
waterdish
who
needs
an
automatic
waterdish
the
next
day
was
worse
i
found
myself
convinced
that
moist
food
was
the
only
way
to
go
my
precious
needed
soft
food
preferably
warmed
for
exactly
15
seconds
in
the
microwave
with
a
soup
on
of
paprika
paprika
what
was
happening
here
i
tried
to
resist
this
silliness
but
i
was
tormented
by
a
fluffy
tail
in
my
face
every
time
i
began
to
fall
asleep
after
two
sleepless
nights
i
caved
i
caved
like
a
wet
tissue
in
a
sneezing
fit
it
was
over
for
me
i
admitted
defeat
i
was
now
the
captive
human
of
a
2
pound
persian
and
her
toy
mouse
getting
to
this
point
has
certainly
taken
years
of
work
by
argentinean
lgbt
organizations
activists
advocates
and
allies
it
has
also
inspired
some
pretty
amazing
television
and
online
video
ads
and
because
this
is
france
the
police
did
not
get
involved
the
media
and
public
were
generally
sympathetic
towards
the
workers
and
the
government
made
rumbling
noises
about
shoring
up
struggling
companies
with
taxpayer's
money
to
protect
jobs

in
the
silence
is
the
real
you
of
course
this
is
assuming
that
apple
will
once
again
add
a
number
to
the
end
of
the
next
iphone
but
they
may
not
they
dropped
the
number
from
the
newest
ipad
and
they
may
continue
this
trend
with
the
iphone
line
but
otherwise
the
phone
will
probably
be
the
iphone

this
is
how
a
training
stud
farm
was
teaching
the
horses
it
s
horrible
abuse
i
will
stick
on
this
case
to
see
if
any
arrests
were
made
because
the
person
who
did
this
needs
flogging
apparently
the
trainer
thought
he
would
use
bale
band
to
tie
the
horses
mouths
to
their
chest

the
mbes
joe
strummers
grave
yah
cause
one
daddy
s
gonna
find
out
she
s
in
love
with
a
from
the
streets
remember
that
line
from
the
cd
writing
romantic
fiction
for
the
past
six
years
and
following
her
destiny
to
write
extraordinary
stories
of
an
average
teenage
life
pj
is
a
member
of
rwa
ctrwa
and
yarwa
she
is
mother
to
two
grown
sons
and
lives
with
her
husband
and
her
dog
in
the
berkshire
hills
of
western
ma
but
from
this
start
exploring
the
more
or
less
scientific
concept
the
story
opens
up
onto
a
more
eccentric
vista
i
used
the
word
poetic
but
there
s
an
obvious
oddity
to
this
term
when
applied
to
television
typically
when
we
use
the
word
poetic
we
really
mean
lyrical
that
is
essentially
working
according
to
a
non
narrative
structure
lyric
poetry
contrasted
with
the
narrative
form
of
epic
poetry
is
a
poetry
based
on
the
expression
of
emotions
but
film
and
television
are
almost
entirely
narrative
media
a
tradition
of
experimental
film
existed
by
1981
but
it
was
still
obscure
and
well
experimental
it
s
not
something
you
can
just
spring
on
bbc1
in
a
family
slot
and
expect
people
to
catch
on
when
they
find
in
any
one
a
germ
of
suspicion
or
dislike
of
another
they
stimulate
the
evil
growth
in
the
united
states
cuban
officials
aren
t
allowed
to
travel
more
than
25
miles
from
their
bases
in
washington
or
at
the
united
nations
in
new
york
without
prior
approval
u
s
officials
in
havana
are
banned
from
leaving
the
city
and
can
meet
only
with
cuban
foreign
ministry
officials
and
we
all
know
that
despite
great
political
difficulties
and
the
inevitable
compromises
that
practical
politics
require
reagan
managed
to
translate
his
words
into
deeds
time
and
time
again
so
just
one
small
example
of
that
may
suffice
as
thomas
sowell
put
it
the
first
problem
with
conversing
with
santa
is
to
figure
out
whether
santa
wants
to
stay
in
character
or
if
you
can
talk
directly
to
the
fat
guy
under
the
suit
i
tried
to
open
with
a
question
that
would
let
him
make
the
choice
but
how
must
we
learn
it
i
can
do
all
things
through
christ
who
strengthens
me
phil

we
have
need
of
strength
from
christ
to
enable
us
to
perform
not
only
those
duties
which
are
purely
christian
but
even
those
which
are
the
fruit
of
moral
virtue
today
i
am
inside
with
poor
jack
who
was
attacked
by
the
nasty
stomach
bug
last
night
oh
well
tho
it
is
sunny
out
it
is
also
cold
so
i
will
putz
at
my
easter
decor
and
maybe
post
some
pics
of
that
soon
this
month
seems
to
have
it
backwards
coming
in
like
a
lamb
and
going
out
like
a
lion
stay
snug
friends
there
will
be
no
future
i
am
saying
finally
without
war
poverty
malthusian
panic
tyranny
cruelty
classes
dead
time
and
all
the
ills
the
flesh
is
heir
to
because
there
will
be
no
future
only
a
present
in
which
the
left
always
embattled
and
marginalized
always
proudly
a
thing
of
the
past
struggles
to
assemble
the
material
for
a
society
nietzsche
thought
had
vanished
from
the
earth
and
this
is
a
recipe
for
politics
not
quietism
a
left
that
can
look
the
world
in
the
face
who
was
our
criminal
matsermind
actually
it
was
flo's
diner
dash
until
recently
the
caja
banking
system
was
virtually
unregulated
yes
you
read
that
correctly
until
about
2010
2011
there
were
next
no
regulations
for
these
banks
which
account
for
50
of
all
spanish
deposits
they
didn
t
have
to
reveal
their
loan
to
value
ratios
the
quality
of
collateral
they
took
for
making
loans
or
anything
for
that
matter
go
back
the
bfg
was
a
pleasant
surprise
of
a
character
he
is
presented
as
a
mysterious
black
cloaked
individual
who
looks
and
is
exceptionally
old
however
the
bfg
has
a
wonderful
child
like
wisdom
that
even
at
sophie's
age
is
subsiding
cambies
was
completely
packed
with
people
no
surprise
there
as
it
is
one
of
the
most
popular
bars
in
downtown
vancouver
lucky
for
the
internex
group
we
were
there
early
so
we
avoided
having
to
stand
in
the
long
long
line
cambies
is
a
great
place
to
find
cheap
beer
an
awesome
atmosphere
and
fun
people
there
are
really
big
tables
that
can
accommodate
a
large
group
such
as
ours
and
the
music
always
gets
you
in
the
mood
to
party
a
minute
later
i
was
out
the
door
my
backpack
full
of
my
school
stuff
and
a
change
of
clothes
i
walked
quickly
crying
hysterically
unable
to
catch
my
breath
each
of
the
three
female
crew
members
have
their
own
personalities
the
doctor
is
always
cheerful
the
communications
specialist
is
very
analytical
and
weary
of
authority
and
the
scanning
expert
does
not
feel
like
she
fits
in
don
ward
owner
of
the
comedy
store
in
london
a
perfectly
named
place
store
instead
of
shop
as
the
idea
being
stolen
from
america
and
store
where
comedy
is
sold
don
ward
once
asked
me
at
an
edinburgh
party
which
lewis
schaffer
do
we
have
tonight
the
funny
lewis
schaffer
or
the
not
funny
lewis
schaffer
my
point
most
people
know
what
they
see
but
don
t
understand
it
really
and
truly
anybody
can
fool
themselves
and
if
it
s
trending
and
there
are
so
many
others
around
them
who
think
the
same
then
there
s
nothing
that
will
ever
question
that
logic
i
also
honestly
think
it
boils
down
to
a
culture
thing
you
can
get
away
with
preaching
for
instance
to
your
white
friends
about
why
they
shouldn
t
listen
to
western
secular
music
but
those
same
white
friends
would
never
question
afrobeats
because
they
don
t
understand
it
it
s
pretty
much
a
safe
zone
the
dangerous
ground
that
is
no
longer
this
week
has
been
pretty
rough
aside
from
planning
operation
letter
and
dealing
with
some
of
my
friends
who
claim
it
is
a
waste
of
time
there
main
reason
being
that
when
hes
comes
out
he
will
be
a
completely
different
person
who
would
not
want
to
deal
with
that
kind
of
we
have
been
tending
to
the
dog
because
he
hurt
himself
i
can
not
say
exactly
what
happened
because
no
one
was
home
at
the
time
all
i
know
is
that
i
left
for
class
in
the
afternoon
came
home
around
ten
at
night
and
asked
by
my
mother
if
he
had
been
limping
he
could
not
walk
on
his
back
paw
at
all
but
he
was
not
crying
or
whimpering
so
we
decided
to
wait
a
day
or
so
to
see
if
he
improved
before
taking
the
last
measure
we
dreaded
they
patiently
wait
for
gram
mijo
to
arrive
after
calling
her
she
told
them
she
would
come
right
over
to
help
assemble
cottonwood
cotton
tetones
as
she
called
them
when
she
was
a
little
girl
into
necklaces
including
more
omega

fatty
acids
into
your
daily
routine
could
help
promote
better
heart
health
and
potentially
reduce
your
risk
for
developing
a
serious
heart
arrhythmia
that
could
pose
dangers
to
your
long
term
health
whenever
i
explained
to
someone
what
the
book
was
about
however
i
d
find
myself
saying
it
wasn
t
really
a
thriller
yes
there
was
a
criminal
aspect
to
it
but
really
it
was
about
the
darker
sides
of
human
nature
i
was
much
more
interested
in
the
psychology
of
the
people
involved
than
in
car
chases
or
the
like
after
a
while
it
struck
me
obviously
happy
hour
was
a
psychological
thriller
that
therefore
had
to
be
my
genre

my
blog
has
seen
little
love
lately
so
i
thought
i'd
share
some
links
to
posts
that
have
been
inspiring
and
interesting
to
me
i
have
been
so
busy
with
christmas
projects
that
i
have
very
little
time
to
write
on
my
blog
of
course
i
want
to
share
what
i
am
working
on
but
then
the
surprises
might
be
blown
especially
since
my
girls
read
my
blog
sometimes
a
few
months
later
i
noticed
bank
fees
being
debited
from
my
account
high
bank
fees
fees
that
when
i
signed
up
for
the
account
was
told
wouldn
t
be
so
high
it
turns
out
i
was
set
up
with
the
wrong
account
by
the
person
at
the
surprise
surprise
yonge
eglinton
branch
instead
of
dealing
with
the
branch
i
took
to
twitter
and
reached
out
to
the
team
there
within
a
few
hours
the
fees
were
returned
to
my
account
and
the
account
was
changed
to
an
unlimited
debit

a
win
for
the
social

team
once
again
i
want
a
girl
who
got
a
badonkadonk
after
about
2
weeks
of
doing
this
they
forgot
the
necessity
and
i
grew
tired
of
always
having
to
ask
for
help
so
one
day
i
tried
getting
into
my
chair
by
myself
and
was
successful
so
some
days
i
d
ask
if
a
co
worker
happened
by
as
i
came
in
and
sometimes
i
d
try
it
myself
it
got
to
the
point
where
i
was
really
paranoid
and
fearful
every
morning
hoping
i
could
manage
to
get
into
my
chair
successfully
if
i
fell
i
wouldn
t
be
able
to
get
up
by
myself
i
had
visions
of
having
to
call
911
and
having
the
firemen
pick
me
up
it
became
my
most
frequent
prayer
every
day
that
i
be
able
to
get
into
my
chair
safely
did
you
know
pineapple
and
raisins
also
go
inside
a
carrot
cake
this
is
one
of
those
cakes
i
was
not
a
fan
of
as
a
kid
but
i
love
it
now
complex
flavors
and
that
cream
cheese
frosting
can
not
go
wrong
this
is
annoying
let
s
face
it
you
didn
t
get
into
the
size
12s
by
being
a
picture
of
restraint
no
you
got
there
through
and
the
immeasurable
amount
of
obscene
things
you
can
do
to
rice
the
skinny
person
can
also
eat
the
rice
but
she
will
do
so
in
a
bird
sized
portions
to
silently
mock
you
if
the
skinny
person
is
a
man
he
will
eat
a
huge
amount
do
three
sit
ups
in
the
morning
and
due
to
the
all
qualities
of
testosterone
the
fat
will
be
gone
almost
instantly
this
is
something
you
just
need
to
live
with
the
informer
is
not
an
easy
read
but
it
is
a
memorable
one
and
may
best
be
described
as
being
an
expressionist
novel
all
the
action
takes
place
over
twelve
hours
which
may
account
for
it
s
relentless
intensity
the
informer
by
liam
o
flaherty
without
doubt
deserves
to
be
read
by
as
wide
an
audience
as
possible
i
have
been
meaning
to
get
to
this
project
for
months
but
finally
had
the
perfect
excuse
i
love
how
crib
and
toddler
bedding
is
interchangeable
making
the
lifetime
of
things
much
longer
my
daughter
recently
transferred
from
a
crib
to
a
toddler
bed
and
i
was
so
excited
to
be
able
to
transfer
the
bedding
along
with
her
even
though
you
possess
plenty
you
are
still
indigent
you
abound
in
temporal
possessions
but
you
need
things
eternal
you
listen
to
the
needs
of
a
human
beggar
yet
yourself
are
a
beggar
of
what
you
do
with
those
who
beg
from
you
is
what
will
do
with
his
beggar
you
are
filled
and
you
are
empty
fill
your
empty
neighbor
with
your
fullness
so
that
your
emptiness
may
be
filled
from
s
fullness

the

routed
them
from

you
are
going
to
start
seeing
an
escalation
as
we
improve
our
techniques
of
bomb
making
and
delivery
that
changed
everything
it
made
history
i
m
not
typing
this
to
embarrass
her
or
to
over
analyze
a
mere
but
i
was
trying
to
examine
the
friendships
i
have
with
certain
people
for
some
i
have
a
certain
decorum
and
act
a
certain
way
for
others
farting
is
our
way
of
saying
you
make
me
gassy
but
i
love
you
i
eat
all
the
gooey
stuff
in

it
confuses

folks
i
am
having
to
force
myself
into
each
new
day
it
has
been
my
remaining
children
and
friends
that
are
pulling
me
kicking
and
screaming
back
into
the
mainstream
of
life
two

you
are
confused
do
not

all
makes

you
think
that

is
photographs
and
endoscopes
and
after
their
latest
acquisitions
medical
waste
disposal
now
look
again
at
the
diagram
above
is
not
that
what
you
see
if
there
was
a
band
that
i
should
have
found
space
for
in
my
top
ten
but
didn
t
it
was
gnr
other
songs
suggested
in
the
comments
included
welcome
to
the
jungle
and
and

city
both
brilliant
but
i
settled
on
sweet
child
o
mine
the
solos
soar
and
the
rhythm
rocks
it
is
perfect
heavy
rock
n'roll
do
not
get
me
wrong
on
one
or
two
songs
they
did
well
and
the
band
was
good
the
show
itself
though
really
really
needs

huge

seven
years
in

could
be
so
close
it
s
a
hard
thing
for
me
to
face
up
to
sometimes
while
the
majority
of
the
world
sits
back
reminiscing
on
s
glory
i
find
myself
in
a
state
of
limbo
not
certain
about
what
i
believe
in
or
think
with
a
bog
of
questions
plaguing
my
mind
as
to
my
religious
convictions
always
wondering
as
to
what
s
true
and
what
s
myth
i
find
myself

services
mullally
appeared
nervous
when
she
took
to
the
stage
not
even
acknowledging
the
audience
until
she'd
sung
two
songs
possibly
in
case
she
was
worried
there'd
be
a
mass
bellowing
of
do
karen
from
the
stalls
i'd
had
her
first
album
for
years
purloined
in
a
divorce
from
a
more
tuneful
ex
so
i
think
i
was
more
prepared
than
some
in
the
audience
i
do
not
think
it
was
really
fair
to
refer
to
this
as
the
 
one
woman
show
 
some
reviewers
were
calling
it
more
 
megan
mullally
in
concert
 
it
would
have
been
nice
to
have
got
more
chat
from
her
the
few
thumbnail
sketches
of
stories
she
threw
in
while
she
was
lining
up
her
lyrics
were
wonderfully
blase
 
about
including
jagger
and
living
downstairs
from
the
woman
who
played
the
villain
in
 
superman
ii
 
but
clearly
she
is
more
comfortable
with
a
coterie
of
hollywood
writers
around
her
as
would
we
all
these
few
insights
were
completely
charming
but
the
juxtaposition
between
this
quiet
almost
nervy
lady
and
the
outlandish
character
she
is
more
well
known
for
was
a
little
too
much
in
the
audience

rows
in

some
shrill
queen
whispered

going

one
more
happy
man
he
looked
up

around
thousands
were
there
so
neglected
and
still
in
need
of
his
attention
he
felt
very
sorry
for
them
deeply
moved
but
time
was
up
many
were
getting
hungry
it
was

the
disciples
were
way

tired

they
still
regretted
that
they
were

their

was
assigned

the

of

opinion
of

a
merciless
battle
of
wills
ensued
from
inside

joe's
mother
was
waging
a
war
of
silence
ignoring
both
his
calls
and
his
relentless
hammering
on
the
doors
and
windows
it
is
hard

joe

anything

hard

it
is

that
he'd
much
rather
be

unfortunately
his
father's
best
advice
was
to
wait

to
calm
down
gbt
joe
pointed
out
that
if
his
mother
had
had
all
night
to
calm
down
and
had
not
by
now
things
were
not
looking
good
having
stood
outside
his
house
for
over
an

without
any
sign
of
his

or
his

spine
gbt
finally
lost
the
proverbial
plot
before
we
get
to
the
root
causes
i
feel
it
is
necessary
for
the
sake
of
those
who
are
not
entirely
familiar
with
this
issue
to
first
discuss
a
few
basic
facts
and
features
hail
satan
back
in
august
we
went
to
a
bbq
at
a
friend's
house
oh
here's
a
picture
of
that
day
on
the
lake
while
we
were
there
they
showed
us
how
they
got
rid
of
the
noisome
chipmunks
who
ate
all
of
their
grapes
and
tomatoes
and
other
garden
offerings
if
you
must
know
it
was
by
setting
up
buckets
of
water
with
food
balanced
on
them
where
the
hungry
chipmunks
would
eventually
meet
their
fates
by
drowning
i
think
keeping
a
travel
journal
is
important
it
s
a
way
to
recall
a
time
and
a
place
that
had
some
significance
to
you
and
a
way
to
share
your
adventures
with
others
in
the
future
it
doesn
t
have
to
be
a
full
length
novel
and
amazon
has
some
interesting
looking
journals
to
get
you
started
here
i
think
we
get
to
the
basic
ethical
problem
that
flat
ontology
opens
and
the
question
of
what
a
flat
ethics
might
look
like
i
m
of
the
mind
that
even
within
an
object
oriented
ontology
ethics
must
nonetheless
be
the
domain
of
the
relational
or
as
morton
might
put
it
the
ecological
however
this
relational
domain
of
the
ethical
must
be
a
strange
kind
of
relation
insofar
as
it
must
be
a
relation
to
the
non
relational
and
a
non
relation
to
the
relational
in
other
words
the
ground
of
the
ethical
would
be
that
moment
where
relations
to
the
non
relational
are
no
longer
governed
by
the
similar
dissimilar
schema
but
where
the
contingency
of
ones
own
system
environment
comes
to
be
recognized
and
perception
of
a
plurality
of
system
environment
distinctions
inhabiting
the
environment
of
a
system
comes
to
be
discerned
in
this
respect
flat
ontology
would
recommend
something
similar
to
the
ethics

difference

give
up
attachment
this
is
a
concept
that
for
most
of
us
is
so
hard
to
grasp
and
i
have
to
tell
you
that
it
was
for
me
too
it
still
is
but
it
s
not
something
impossible
you
get
better
and
better
at
with
time
and
practice
the
moment
you
detach
yourself
from
all
things
and
that
doesn
t
mean
you
give
up
your
love
for
them
because
love
and
attachment
have
nothing
to
do
with
one
another
attachment
comes
from
a
place
of
fear
while
love
well
real
love
is
pure
kind
and
self
less
where
there
is
love
there
can
t
be
fear
and
because
of
that
attachment
and
love
cannot
coexist
you
become
so
peaceful
so
tolerant
so
kind
and
so
serene
you
will
get
to
a
place
where
you
will
be
able
to
understand
all
things
without
even
trying
a
state
beyond
words
like
that
woman
who
just
passed
us
she
is
miserable
and
the
reason
i
know
that
is
because
i
used
to
do
that
i
would
think
about
how
i
wanted
to
look
and
who
i
wanted
to
look
like
i
would
pressure
myself
to
have
the
perfect
figure
reach
a
certain
weight
fit
into

size
and

was
willing
to
do
anything

programmed
more

140
films

there
was

what
the

paul
did

in
i
haven

seen
titanic
since
december
of

that
s
on
purpose
i
ve
accidentally
seen
random
scenes
here
and
there
on
tv
but
other
than
that
my
memory
of
the
film
is
entirely
based
on
my
recollection
from
that
one
single
viewing
i
wrote
this
blog
over
the
course
of
a
couple
of
weeks
and
i
discussed
some
of
my
points
with
some
known
titanic
fans
throughout
the
process
i
ve
come
to
realize
that
some
of
the
details
of
my
arguments
specifically
relating
to
the
ins
and
outs
of
the
specific
plot
are
possibly
not
entirely
accurate
i
ve
decided
to
leave
the
points
as
is
and
am
planning
a
follow
up
post
where
i
re
watch
the
film
in
its
2d
entirety
and
adjust
my
opinions
as
needed
i
promise
to
be
honest
with
my
re
assessment
yes
or
no
faber
we
had
the
big
move
the
gold
price
overshot
when
it
went
to
1
921
on
sept
6
last
year
and
then
we
oversold
on
dec
29
when
gold
went
down
very
quickly
to
1
522
i
suppose
around
this
level
gold
s
price
is
moving
sideways
i
wouldn
t
mortgage
my
house
expecting
prices
to
go
up
they
could
still
go
down
more
and
we
would
still
be
in
a
bull

if

prices
dropped
to

is
really
improving
in
his
reading
we
had
a
nice
time
together
though
i
really
had
to
pray
that
the
lord
would
help
me
leave
the
incidents
at
school
behind
he
answered
my
prayer
and
gave
me
the
strength
to
encourage
h
and
be
completely
attentive
to
j
there
was
road
construction
along
the
main
route
back
home
so
the
taxi
driver
had
to
take
the
long
way
thankfully
i
was
wearing
my
sunglasses
and
he
could
not
ask
me
any
questions
i
bought
some
new
kurdish
sunglasses
when
i
went
to
the
market
with
t
since
wearing
them
i
have
noticed
that
i
do
not
get
honked
at
or
nee
howed
wherever
i
go
the
dark
hair
comes
in
handy
it
must've
been
wheelchair
day
we
saw
a
mom
wheeling
her
delayed
teenager
through
the
toy
aisles
i
smiled
at
her
and
we
continued
passing
them
all
throughout
the
store
was
her
daughter
on
target
not
a
bit
but
she
was
happy
and
enjoying
spending
time
with
her
mama
then
i
saw
a
gorgeous
teenager
not
delayed
but
also
in
a
chair
wheeling
herself
through
the
card
aisle
giggling
with
her
girlfriends
i
am
sure
her
mom's
heart
broke
when
she
realized
her
daughter
would
be
in
a
wheelchair
but
her
daughter
was
well
adjusted
happy
even
carefree
waterproofing
will
they
still
exist
may
we
give
thanks
in
all
things
being
reminded
that
we
are
not
entitled
to
anything
on
this
earth
and
in
so
doing
may
we
grow
in
humility
may
your
act
of
thanksgiving
the
next
few
days
be
an
act
of
worship
and
may
it
saturate
every
area
and
every
day
of
your
life
the
bath
tub
will
not
drain
the
sink
is
leaking
and
the
toilet
will
not
flush
sound
like
every
one's
worst
nightmare
right
we
all
know
the
home
repair
projects
that
can
wait
but
what
about
the
one's
that
can
not
plumbing
is
nothing
to
let
go
i
have
played
that
game
before
and
i
realized
things
only
cost
more
money
when
you
do
not
keep
up
on
your
home
maintenance
face
it
we
all
hate
to
call
a
professional
in
to
do
projects
but
sometimes
it
just
can
not
be
helped
temecula
plumbing
can
help
you
in
any
situation
my
bath
tub
was
not
draining
and
of
course
we
plunged
and
plunged
till
finally
the
water
just
sat
there
we
were
actually
bailing
some
of
the
water
out
every
time
we
wanted
to
take
a
shower
talk
about
desperate
we
waited
so
long
to
get
the
drain
professionally
unclogged
that
of
course
when
we
had
a
done
we
experienced
a
broken
pipe
yet
another
cost
i
really
did
not
want
heres
the
long
story
long
have
we
bemoaned
the
lack
of
a
centralized
resource
for
tracking
upcoming
releases
and
books
in
progress
readeralert
helps
with
the
first
you
can
create
custom
searches
by
author
genre
and
subject
so
that
you
can
be
notified
when
new
books
are
either
released
or
scheduled
for
release
it
s
not
quite
as
precise
as
we
d
like
but
this
is
definitely
a
step
in
the
right
direction

since
its
opening
in

the
hotel
has
undergone
many
changes
and
has
had
a
couple
of
new
owners
in
the
lobby
you
can
find
the
elaborate
private
collections
from
these
owners
in
the
several
sitting
areas
after
adding
several
hundred
more
guest
rooms
and
updating
their
looks
the
san
marcos
resort
has
become
what
dr
chandler
always
dreamed
it
would
be
an
oasis
in
the
desert
in
one
i
was
driving
a
car
in
which
all
72
of
us
were
riding
i
had
no
idea
where
we
were
or
even
where
we
were
going
but
i
didn
t
want
to
admit
it
so
i
kept
trying
to
get
my
bearings
by
looking
at
road
signs
because
i
was
going
a
little
fast
i
missed
a
curve
we
ended
up
in
a
large
flat
area
and
came
to
a
stop
facing
the
way
we
had
come
still
not
wanting
to
admit
my
ignorance
i
said
i
was
just
turning
around
meal
included
breakfast
there
was
a
brief
countdown
and
we
were
off
running
into
a
wooded
area
initially
on
heavily
watered
trail
of
mud
and
then
very
quickly
off
of
the
trail
without
a
trail
we
had
to
dodge
trees
and
logs
and
boulders
fighting
the
overgrowth
while
striding
carefully
enough
to
avoid
injury
the
uneven
territory
made
for
several
runners
falling
very
early
in
the
race
tumbling
or
rolling
their
ankles
none
seriously
that
i
saw
my
team
of
9
was
for
the
most
part
grouped
together
at
this
point
and
we
made
it
through
the
first
portion
of
the
run
only
a
half
mile
or
so
amidst
a
bunch
of
hoorah
s
 
the
first
obstacle
was
kiss
of
mud
the
tomb
of
jesus
was
continually
guarded
it
was
closed
with
a
2
000
pound
stone
making
it
impossible
for
even
a
healthy
man
to
open
it
from
the
inside
we
know
that
a
soldier
would
never
take
a
body
down
unless
the
person
was
dead
if
he
did
and
the
prisoner
escaped
the
soldier
would
be
subject
to
a
penalty
of
death
we
also
know
that
when
the
soldier
pierced
christ
s
body
there
was
a
flow
of
water
and
blood
which
is
a
clear
indication
that
there
was
a
separation
of
clot
and
serum
which
is
strong
medical
evidence
of
death

1965
when
30
000

people
in
the

northeast
were
in
the
dark
due
to
a
massive
cme
event
living
with
my
parents
on
long
island
i
remember
this
one
my
sister
remembers
it
even
better
she
was
returning
home
from
nyc
on
a
high
school
bus
when
the
entire
city
skyline
simply
disappeared
before
her
eyes
lights
out
if
you

said

bunny
there
are
many
in
the
media
and
within
scottish
football
who
seem
to
believe
that
some
form
of
ibrox
club
is
so
important
that
it
must
be
allowed
into
the
spl
no

those
who
talk
about
inequality
are
trying
to
create
a
link
that
is
not
there
but
that
does
not
mean
they
are
short
on
solutions
the
answer
to
equality
is
of
course
redistribution
which
must
by
necessity
be
overseen
by
the
state
tortuga
i
do
love
her
and
need
her
did
you
have
a
chance
to
check
out
the
awesome
ideas
from
last
week
no
well
after
you
link
up
this
week
go
look
through
the
ideas
from
last
week
because
there
are
some
amazing
ideas
rejuvenation
my
co
workers
and
i
sometimes
hold
organic
church
conferences
throughout
the
country
these
events
are
designed
to
do
several
things
one
is
to
equip
believers
to
be
prepared
to
live
body
life
another
is
to
connect
people
together
who
are
like
minded
concerning
organic
church
in
their
geographical
area
these
events
are
training
and
equipping
events
they
are
not
meant
to
be
organic
church
meetings
needless
to
say
i
end
up
with
a
huge
stack
of
books
around
my
bed
some
weeks
i
have
to
literally
leap
over
the
stack
to
get
into
bed
and
not
to
mention
there
is
a
whole
 
nother
group
of
books
that
i
have
purchased
and
are
on
the
reading
list
too
so
this
is
library
books
and
purchased
books
that
i
have
to
leap
over
serious
exercise

now
in
the
case
of
the
couple
above
who
presumably
find
the
national
census
offensive
the
motivation
was
probably
that
they
would
receive
some
sort
of
tangible
benefit
vouchers
the
entitlement
to
dine
free
or
even
cash
however
i
believe
that
there
may
be
a
latent
motive
which
is
far
more
sinister
though
perhaps
not
conscious
in
some
of
the
 
aggrieved
 
the
venus
project
is
an
organization
that
proposes
a
feasible
plan
of
action
for
social
change
one
that
works
towards
a
peaceful
and
sustainable
global
civilization
it
outlines
an
alternative
to
strive
toward
where
human
rights
are
no
longer
paper
proclamations
but
a
way
of
life
my

not

a

another
way
to
understand
fine
crystal
is
to
examine
the
purpose
various
pieces
are
designed
to
serve
similar
to
the
way
a
knife
is
designed
to
cut
and
a
spoon
to
scoop
and
sip
soup
crystal
stemware
has
its
own
designations
the
use
of
the
following
pieces
is
obviously
more
ambiguous
because
they
are
all
used
for

not
eating

we
easily

outstanding

questioning

sarah
palin
is
not
presidential
material
i
can
easily
say
that
despite
the
fact
that
i
do
not
disagree
with
everything
she
spouts
off
about
she
is
very
fond
of
telling
us
what
is
wrong
in
america
and
there
are
things
wrong
in
america
today
that
is
easy
to
say
what
i
have
never
heard
her
utter
is
solutions
to
fixing
what
is
wrong
in
america
though
she
is
all
rhetoric
and
sound
bite
and
continued
with
setting
the
scene
wordstock
literary
fest
is
crazy
for
me
i
have
back
to
back
readings
and
interviews
for
two
days
this
year
i
interviewed
anne
enright
and
anna
solomon
and
did
event
coverage
for
michael
ondaatje
isabel
wilkerson
barry
lopez
steve
almond
peter
mountford
charles
yu
and
others
i
can
t
recall
at
the
moment
plus
i
wanted
to
get
all
my
first
editions
signed
so
i
would
do
the
interview
record
the
reading
take
pics
and
then
rush
to
the
signing
area
it
was
during
a
signing
that
i
met
jennifer
egan
when
she
saw
my
press
pass
she
asked
me
with
a
smile
on
her
face
why
i
hadn
t
asked
to
interview
her
i
told
her
that
i
didn
t
think
she
would
have
time
she
laughed
and
gave
me
her
email
address
and
said
to
contact
her
which
i
will
definitely
do
lovely
lady
i
still
haven
t
posted
all
the
wordstock
coverage
to
my
site
and
all
those
calls
from
the

tsp

powder
my
family
is
really
being
super
good
sports
so
far
i
have
to
tell
you
even
the
recipes
that
we
make
and
are
keeping
are
not
delicious
we
keep
them
because
they
are
edible
i
can
totally
see
why
so
fewer
people
were
obese
100
years
ago
there
is
no
chance
of
stuffing
your
face
just
because
the
food
is
so
good
you
eat
because
you
are
hungry
and
as
soon
as
you
are
not
hungry
you
stop
eating
we
are
back
to
looking
at
food
purely
as
fuel
i
suppose
that
is
a
healthier
relationship
to
have
with
food
but
it
is
hard
last
night
a
commercial
for
chili's
restaurant
came
on
and
i
thought
i
was
going
to
die
big
saucy
cheesy
dishes
brownie
and
ice
cream
smothered
in
hot

can
not

right
now
christian
marclay
s
the
clock
is
probably
the
closest
cinema
has
ever
come
to
representing
real
life
in
real
time
in
all
its
complexity
there
is
a
similar
pattern
on
the
canadian
venture
exchange
it
has
posted
lower
lows
for
9
weeks
in
a
row
it
did
post
one
weekly
gain
but
earlier
in
the
week
it
made
a
new
low
so
this
also
fits
into
the
analysis
no
matter
the
sinful
actions
you
have
committed
there
is
still
a
chance
for
you
to
redeem
salvation
from
our
sovereign
lord
loves
you
so
much
that
he
has
been
by
your
side
this
whole
time
doesn
t
see
you
for
the
sins
you
have
committed
but
instead
he
sees
you
for
who
you
really
are
by
seeking
your
heart
instead
of
your
actions
because
if
it
didn
t
it
would
mean
they
would
look
for
life
just
like
the
ones
the
sentence
article
74
last
week
i
talked
about
the
truth
and
how
the
truth
is
one
of
the
building
blocks
of
our
lives
this
is
the
predominant
theme
that
runs
through
jude
as
jude
looks
to
close
the
letter
he
adds
what
is
called
an
exhortation
to
believers
basically
jude
is
trying
to
help
prepare
the
believers
for
their
necessary
struggles
as
a
consequence
for
living
in
the
truth

please
go

for

but
regardless
of
whether
it
is

2
7
grams
of
protein
i
add
two
of
them
to
my
smoothies
they
taste
like
nothing
and
get
more
than
5
grams
of
protein
right
there
then
i
add
a
tablespoon
of
spirulina
which
has
5
grams
all
on
it
is
own
that
is
more
than
10
grams
of
protein
in
that
one
drink
before
i
add
any

or
greens
that
rivals
any
commercial
protein
shakes
that
rely
on
casein
which
the
china

links

there
s
an

tale
that
the
players
have
told
aw
the

if
they
win
the
game
el
capitan
would
be
the
man
to
lift

this
shows

all
of

were
done
in

look
on
my

for

and
discount
code
to
get
a
copy
of
this
fun
program
for
yourself
the
price
after
the
ten
dollar
discount
is
very
reasonable
hopefully
things
will
settle
out
this
week
and
i
will
be
able
to
get
back
to
work
i
have
got
lots
of
ideas
jumping
around
in
my
head
i
need
start
letting
some
of
them
out
before
they
cause
a
riot
that
is
the
thing
about
ideas
they
can
be
quite
dangerous
when
they
put
their
mind
to
it
i
use
art
as
my
means
to
get
rid
of
stress
i
journal
to
help
work
out
issues
i
create
other
art
to
give
myself
the
feeling
of
accomplishment
and
self
worth
i
try
to
make
my
art
both
crazy
and
happy
just
to
make
anyone
who
sees
it

krabby
is
simply
based
on
a
crab
it
s
one
of
the
more
realistic
ie
it
looks
like
the
animal
it
s
based
on
designs
for
pokemon
though
are
only
that
colour
when
they
re
cooked
its
japanese
name
is
simply
crab
in
the
anime
and
the
game
pokepark
wii
krabby
walks
sideways
like
real
do
instead
of
saying
their
name
like
most
pokemon
do
krabby
goes
kooky
kooky
how
would
you
describe
the
relationship
between
winter
and
her
sister
lucy
here
is
my
list
in
no
particular
order
i
think
that
makes
sense
that
s
a
good
way
to
talk
about
it
as
you
write
you
re
trying
to
make
it
vibrate
in
the
way
you
d
make
an
instrument
vibrate
and
there
are
sounds
in
the
way
and
you
ve
got
to
write
until
all
that
other
sound
is
out
of
the
way
the
things
i
write
are
products
of
a
very
urgently
felt
need
to
understand
the
world
in
a
way
that
s
livable
and
it
would
be
strange
if
that
didn
t
infuse
some
of
them
with
a
kind
of
energy
that
s
the
real
unifying
thing
in
a
way
it
s
not
anything
more
than
saying
you
re
another
writer
that
is
my
table
mate
diane
gonthier
in
the
photo
i
am
also
thinking
of
making
a
few
changes
to
this
blog
design
and
perhaps
also
some
extra
content
posts
not
always
crafty
shock
horror
lol
oh
well
we
will
see
i
feel
like
i
ve
been
attacked
i
don
t
remember
the
last
time
i
felt
this
emotionally
drained
this
alone
this
exhausted
this
angry
every
shameful
thing
i
ve
done
every
bad
decision
i
ve
made
it
s
all
suddenly
been
brought
to
the
light
and
i
m
exposed
standing
alone
amidst
my
pain
and
my
brokenness
trying
to
figure
out
how
to
pick
up
all
the
pieces
on
my
own
mdletshe
said
the
driver
of
the
vip
vehicle
was
reportedly
catching
up
to
the
official
cavalcade
and
tried
to
overtake
at
which
point
he
lost
control
and
collided

on
into
the
oncoming
traffic

there
was
a
common
language
the
influence
of
french
in
the

continues
to
this
day
and
there
are
of
course
many
hispanic
media
channels
and
communities
but
if
you
go
to
the

in

even
though
they
use
odd
words
for

i
am
one
that
likes
to
layer
the
papers
and
create
depth
within
that
process
building
the
history
of
the
art
piece
itself
i
have
a
good
sense
for
composition
and
design
and
almost
all
of
my
work
comes
from
how
i
am
feeling
about
things
on
a
daily
basis
spiritually
and
emotionally
color
is
another
strong
aspect
to
my
work
and
very
natured
inspired
i
actually
take
better
care
of
my
running
shoes
then
any
of
my
other
shoes
too
only
wear
them
for
the
work
outs
unlace
the
shoes
box
them
up
afterwards
its
kinda
odd
my
obsession
with
them
leave
me
be
she
hurled
over
her
shoulder
and
limped
onward
but
the
shade
kept
pace
staying
far
enough
back
to
follow
without
being
seen
we
used
to
petro
said
back
at
the
start
now
we
ve
got
self
winding

he
pulled
himself
up
onto
the
rope
and
grabbed
onto
an
ideally
placed
knot
leaving
space
for
felicity
to
do
the
same
underneath
him
which
pulls
us
up
felicity
s
heart
was
pounding
but
reminding
herself
how
far
she
had
already
come
she
grabbed
onto
the
lower
knot
and
lost
contact
with
the
tree
and
with
that
the
last
remnant
of
terra
firma
hold
on
tight
petro
said
but
this
time
think
solid
thoughts
both
you
and
the
rope
are
insubstantiated
ideally
i'd
have
a
room
like
this
all
to
myself
ok
in
my
most
fantastic
dreams
i'd
have
a
room
even
a
tiny
one
with
a
view
of
the
sea
there
is
something
about
the
ocean
that
seems
to
inspire
my
creative
side
but
i
am
not
complaining
not
for
a
minute
i
am
thrilled
with
the
place
i
have
got
hm
except
for
the
lack
of
bookshelves
i
have
to
go
to
other
rooms
for
my
book
collection
if
i
want
to
refer
to
something
other
than
the
thesaurus
on
my
desk
oh
it
is
a
hard
life
deadline
oh
and
yesterday
i
took
a
day
trip
to
pennsylvania
with
a
group
from
church
dennis
took
the
day
off
and
stayed
with
his
mom
we
went
up
to
the
sights
sounds
theater
this
time
to
see
the
story
of
joseph
and
his
multi
colored
coat
it
was
fabulous
of
course
it
was
we
had
lunch
at
an
amish
inn
the
food
of
course
was
excellent
and
of
course
i
ate
too
much
but
i
let
myself
do
these
things
on
occasion
and
just
accept
a
little
gain
should
it
happen
i
thought
for
sure
i
would
gain
after
st
patrick's
day
but
i
did
not
it
was
amazing
perhaps
i
will
be
so
blessed
this
time
too
tomorrow
is
weigh
day
so
i
will
know
then
we
started
with
a
shrimp
cocktail
and
ahi
tuna
that
was
out
of
this
world
i
m
not
sure
what
type
of
sauce
they
drizzled
on
the
plate
but
it
was
a
bit
sweet
and
spicy
totally
made
the
dish
until
we
find
the
love
we
missed
we
are

back

former

cover
i
ended
up
needing
to
trim
it
quite
a

and
add

in

to
square
it
up
but
i
think
i
like
it
even
more

than
without

think
it
will
eventually
become
a

to

also
felt
like
updating
my

since
my

have
boring

certainly
there
was
an
undercurrent
of
things
esoteric
in
the
most
mystical

of
the

beneath
the
surface
of
illuminism
in
this
respect
the

followed
exactly
in
the
footsteps
of
the

templars
the
templars
returned
to

after

a

the
transformation
of
my
son's
toddler
room
into
a
big
boy
room
was
definitely
the
most
rewarding
he
is
such
a
sweetheart
and
had
been
waiting
so
patiently
for
his
room
to
match
his
maturity
picturing
his
expression
when
i
revealed
the
room
to
him
still
brings
tears
to
my
eyes
and
the
fact
that
this
room
was
featured
on
numerous
sites
including
design
sponge
ohdeedoh
babycenter
casasugar
and
centsational
girl
certainly
did
not
hurt
in
the
attention
it
received
today
was
one
of
those
bursts
of
creativity
i
mean
i
woke
up
and
couldn
t
wait
to
get
my
hands
around
my
hot
glue
gun
i
don
t
have
these
kinds
of
days
too
often
but
when
i
do
it
is
absolutely
liberating
a
new
study
shows
that
the
majority
of
americans
do
not
trust
the
leftist
propagandists
of
the
msm
that
is
good
news
but
there
is
still
work
to
be
done
to
finally
and
permanently
wrench
the
narrative
from
the
liars
looters
and
destroyers
which
is
why
you
should
do
what
you
can
to
support
conservative

for
this

in

to
the

you
can
also

shopping
through

at

remember
lots

have

a

prominently
in
the

you
might
expect
with

one
of
the
most
delightful
oyster
dishes
you
could
imagine
simple
fresh
oysters
were

oysters

on

of
sweet
pumpkin
puree
this
when
combined
with
a
crisp

james

created
a
rare

sensation
some
writers
have
even
said
that
it
does
not
amount
to
hacking
where
simply
someone
accesses
a
phone
s
messages
because
the
default
pin
code
has
not
been
changed
it
was
not
clear
who
were
the
first
tea
drinkers
the
legend
of
emperor
shen
nong
was
a
bit
far
off
in
my
opinion
as
the
early
writers
always
seem
to
attribute
important
discoveries
to
their
rulers
to
glorify
them
some
research
also
suggests
that
it
was
the
mon
khmer
people
in
burma
who
discovered
it
based
on
the
etymology
of
the
words
for
tea
regardless
we
know
that
the
chinese
were
the
first
to
popularize
the
drink
and
to
perfect
the

against
furious
leftist
opposition
reagan
already
had
well
underway
by
the
time
of
reyjavik
a
huge
buildup
of
american
conventional
forces
so
that
deterrence
by
conventional
strength
was
at
least
potentially
available
to
replace
nuclear
deterrence
and
by
the
time
any
anti
nuclear
agreement
became
effective
there
would
of
course
also
be
time
even
for
western
europe
to
begin
pulling
its
weight
in
conventional
defence
a
prospect
which
europe
particularly
mrs
thatcher
resisted
vigorously
of
course
so
this
new
job
will
be
physically
easier
but
i
am
scared
of
high
school
kids
i
remember
high
school
i
was
not
a
good
kid
i
just
pray
that
doesn
t
come
back
to
bite
me
in
the
i
am
truly
excited
though
it
s
a
job
that
if
and
when
i
do
become
pregnant
again
i
won
t
have
to
worry
about
losing
it
or
taking
time
off
i
m
ready
for
the
change
i
m
ready
for
new
i
think
it
will
help
me
get
through
this
bump
in
my
life
nothing
good
comes
from
sitting
at
home
moping
all
day
i
m
not
much
of
a
moper
though
i
just
get
off
and
use
the
word
a
lot
lol
that
s
it
there
s
never
been
a
documented
case
of
anyone
contracting
in
a
normal
household
setting
you
can
t
get
it
by
drinking
out
of
the
same
cup
by
giving
hugs
or
kisses
wrestling
or
just
being
plain
goofy
what
every
normal
family
does
time
flies
by
in
rapid
style
in
the
month
of
dark
grey
monsoons
when
was
the
last
time
we
saw
consistent
big
plays
down
the
field
to
a
big
wide
receiver
eric
moulds
ok
so
terrell
owens
provided
a
small
cure
here
and
there
but
he
didn
t
get
the
job
done
with
all
his
hype
he
was
also
started
on
a
second
more
powerful
antibiotic
his
little
body
was
being
bombarded
and
i
just
hoped
that
we
would
see
improvement
soon
here's
the
quick
and
the
avian
gospels
is
a
story
about
a
nameless
war
ravaged
city
that
is
suddenly
unexpectedly
buried
beneath
a
plague
of
birds
for
no
known
reason
millions
of
them
flock
to
the
city
at
once
blotting
out
the
sun
and
covering
the
ground
in
a
blanket
of
feathers
and
beaks
i
had
on
a
really
comfortable
flattering
outfit
that
i
felt
really
confident
in
how
often
does
that
happen
that
s
like
the
fashion
trifecta
or
something
isn
t
it
plus
i
got
three
compliments
which
boosted
my
spirits
even
more
from
static
to
moldable
plasticity
along
came
this
lovely
lass
who
asked
me
how
much
i
was
looking
to
spend
after
i'd
explained
that
i
did
not
want
to
spend
much
she
ushered
us
over
to
the
expensive
st
tropez
self
tanning
stuff
and
proceeded
to
try
and
sell
it
to
me
oh
gee
why
did
not
i
see
that
one
coming
after
about
10
minutes
of
her
trying
her
hardest
to
sell
it
to
me
i
was
exhausted
and
out
of
objections
so
ended
up
buying
the
stuff

but
i
went
to
the
cocktail
party
with
christina
and
met
more
people
and
handed
out
more
cards
and
noted
mildly
out
loud
the
predominant
caucasian
presence
at
this
conference
other
locals
and
i
think
it
feels
strange
since
we
are

more
a

hit

it

greg

a
journalist
at
local
newspaper
la

li
ge
described
the
scene
we
saw
four
explosions
i
was
in
a
building
200m
from
saint
lambert
square
he
said
it
was
quite
incredible
we
saw
one
man
on
the
roof
who
tried
to
people
this
man
killed
himself
with
a
grenade
there
is
a
whisper
of
revolution
then
it
will
be
a
murmur
then
it
will
talk
then
it
will
shout
i
tried
to
find
out
how
someone
could
do
that
without
my
permission
the
representative
gave
me
a
sketchy
answer
then
told
me
i
could
put
a
purchase
blocker
on
my
number
that
would
keep
it
from
happening
again
sounded
good
to
me
but
i
had
to
giggle
when
i
realized
that
i'd
signed
up

that

has
previously

you
as
move
in

to
create
a
new
realm
of
creation
there
is
a
reason
for
you
doing
so
persons
have
deduced
that
created
man
in
response
to
the
devil
and
his
angels
falling
that
created
man
as
a
separate
race
in
order
to
give
a
new
race
power
to
choose
and
to
play
out
a
conflict
on
earth
between
and
satan
relative
to
man
and
man
s
choice
of
there
really
is
no
reason
to
think
this
it
s
just
an
assumption
based
on
human
reason
and
partial
light
of
s
word
knowing
that
created
man
man
fell
and
a
battle
is
ensuing
on

between
and

relative

and
this

s
lay
aside
our
own
human
assumptions
and
do
a
deep
dive
into
the
word
of
a
short
deep
dive
into
s
word
to
hear
reveal
the
answer
in
part
then
let
us
be
transformed
by
the
renewing
of
our
mind
as
we
give
up
our
own
concepts
arrived
at
through
conjecture
human
deduction
and
assumption
and
let
us
gain
the
spirit
of
wisdom
and
revelation
as
we
reject
our
own

separate
of
and
receive

i
can
sort

tell
what
she
looks

or
used
to
look
like
but
only
sort
of
it
s
different
now
she
fed
on
poverty
and
indignation
she
learned
to
thrive
on
paranoia
she
drank
with
exotic
dancers
and
junkies
and
poets
she
had
to
struggle
with
a
job
and
most
days
the
outcome
was
in
doubt
whether
she

afford

a
voice
from
1907
ive
always
wanted
to
adopt
as
long
as
i
can
remember
it
just
always
seemed
right
to
me
to
help
someone
in
need
create
a
family
and
still
be
able
to
make
the
world
a
little
more
like
me
without
having
to
give
birth
plus
i
always
feared
the
worst
my
biological
baby
was
sure
to
end
up
an
ex
vegan
pro
life
evangelical
preacher
police
chief
libertarian
i
was
never
able
to
shake
this
despite
constant
societal
pressures
for
me
to
get
married
and
have
babies
as
a
woman
that
was
all
i
was
supposed
to
be
interested
in
if
i
had
a
nickel
for
every
person
that
told
me
it
s
a
phase
or
wait
til
you
meet
the
right
person
or
you
ll
understand
later
i
would
be
a
gajillionaire
to
be
honest
it
was
really
scary
thinking
that
the
thoughts
i
had
were
somehow
invalid
and
stalled
i
thought
i
knew
who
i
was
as
i
get
older
ive
learned
that
my
thoughts
were
worthwhile
and
justified
not
now
but
later
i
do
want
to
adopt
children
they
won
t
look
like
me
and
might
not
end
up
being
the
same
species
but
one
day
i
will
have
my
own
kind
of
family
afterwards
we
met
up
with
friends
for
dessert
which
also
helped
cool
our
burning
mouths
i
had
mango
doufuhua
again
this
was
my
fave
of
the
two
it
has
a
better
mango
to
tofu
ratio
and
was
slightly
tangy
as
well
as
sweet
and
makes
eye
contact
i
guess
some
people
find
it
amusing
to
see
a
western
kid
jumping
on
a
stone
horse
i
would
also
take
a
picture
of
that
this
week's
ingredients
are
coincidental
i
made
the
cake
for
the
sunday
dinner
with
the
family
and
forgot
to
take
a
picture
with
all
the
commotion
with
a
five
year

old
and
seven

old
and
the

was
made

and
it
is

throughout

i
did
not
say
that
no
one
ever
really
says
that
the
general
structure
of
the
financial
cabal
and
its
top
leaders
has
also
now
been
mapped
to

extent
for

have

the

rending
the
burden
was
lifted
when
i
took
a
long
walk
which
gave
me
time
to
think
and
ask
questions
of
myself
what
drew
me
to
unschooling
in
the
first
place
what
keeps
my
family
and
me
unschooling
now
prior
to
the
1990s
it
was
clear
to
me
what
atheism
atheists
agnosticism
agnostics
dogma
and
fanaticism
were
that
s
because
we
had
clear
and
logically
consistent
definitions
of
those
words
they
were
found
in
reliable
dictionaries
like
webster
s
new
world
dictionary
here
are
the
definitions
i
found
in
the
1975
edition
which
i
still
own
and
use
consulting
with
griefcom's
foreign
rights
chair
charles
sheffield
it
soon
became
clear
that
dave's
complaint
was
the
tip
of
the
iceberg
there
was
an
enormous
problem
with

and
novels
were
being
sold
to
european
publishers
but
authors
weren
t
receiving
royalties
in
many
cases
writers
were
not
even
aware
that
the
sales
had
been
made
here's
a
typical
complaint
three
strikes
and
your
out
barry
and
guilt
in
heart
sometimes
i
despair
of
my
species
sometimes
even
listening
to
bach
doesn
t
help
the
liberal
community
can
t
quite
seem
to
grasp
this
concept
are
they
even
liberals
at
all
they
want
freedom
for
themselves
they
want
civil
rights
if
they
would
put
their
efforts
towards
cleaning
out
the
gop
instead
of
bad
mouthing
it
constantly
that
would
be
the
party
that
would
be
the
logical
choice
for
them
to
support
the
downside
of
course
is
the
price
but
if
you
are
working
in
manhattan
and
you
are
going
to
about
the
prices
change
jobs
and
when
you
have
got
the
best
job
in
the
city
a
sandwich
is
a
small
price
to
pay
for
the
feeling
you
get
going
to
bed
at
dawn
knowing
you
have
more
in
common
with
batman
at
that
moment
than
anyone
you
know
update
i
emailed
boyfriend
at
work
and
i
was
like
if
someone
asked
you
the
question
 
babies
not
sticking
to
 
how
would
you
respond
10
if
you
do
want
transport
research
private
car
companies
you
can
usually
find
a
limo
company
that
will
pick
you
up
from
jfk
for
80
or
so
if
you
are
a
group
of
4
it
works
out
the
same
as
getting
the
bus
whilst
this
may
suit
some
and
all
power
to
the
guys
running
it
i
think
i
am
developing
my
simple
idea
of
what
makes
a
good
pub
it
is
so
simple
yet
seemingly
hard
to
find
2
wash
and
peel
off
any
damaged
leaves
from
the
sprouts
trim
the
root
end
and
cut
in
half
the
turn
of
the
tide
against
the
forces
of
darkness
will
not
come
by
military
power
or
a
bomb
it
will
come
because
women
and
men
of
good
will
have
seen
in
the
distance
the
spark
that
calls
them
to
respond
to
put
flame
to
their
beacon
and
to
call
the
world
into
communion
let
us
keep
our
eyes
on
the
lord
this
week
let
us
watch
and
pray
with
him
and
may
the
spark
of
the
divine
light
ignite
something
deep
within
each
of
us
so
that
we
too
may
become
beacons
calling
out
for
the
return
of
the
king
this
is
precisely
what
chris
hedges
points
out
in
the
debate
in
asserting
that
the
power
of
protest
movements
is
in
their
powerlessness
kids
with
rocks
against
tanks
is
essentially
non
violent
protest
since
there
s
no
chance
of
the
rocks
killing
anyone
any
protest
movement
can
only
succeed
by
getting
people
especially
people
inside
the
power
structure
off
the
sidelines
and
supporting
the
movement
where
to
begin
i
suppose
i
should
start
with
march
7
2011
and
go
from
there
now
i
have
no
clue
how
this
got
started
or
anything
but
since
it
is
monday
today
and
i
won
something
then
i
am
so
into
thinking
and
hoping
that
i
will
win
something
else
later
this
week
it
puts
a
smile
on
my
face
and
a
little
spring
in
my
step
being
a
mother
daughter
duo
ourselves
we
love
having
brides
and
their
mama
s
come
in
to
talk
wedding
and
flowers
alicia
had
her
mum
lending
a
hand
from
start
to
finish
these
two
didn
t
miss
a
detail
fall
is
a
beautiful
time
for
a
wedding
such
crisp
colours
alicia
s
choice
of
varied
reds
yellows
and
oranges
complimented
the
background
of
their
special
day
perfectly
the
couples
primary
flower
was
the
dahlia
so
pretty
7
alabama
sings
the
next
question
is
where
do
we
start
however
we
try
to
return
to
our
roots
to
remember
that
which
we
have
unconsciously
forgotten
the
most
important
thing
we
must
keep
in
mind
just
start
the
ball
rolling
i
even
managed
to
get
hold
of
a
large
moroccan
tent
that
had
been
shipped
over
from
the
sahara
we
put
it
up
in
the
garden
as
the
perfect
accommodation
for
those
adventurous
spirits
looking
for
a
glamping
glamorous
camping
experience
as
karissa
and
others
will
vouch
it
was
worth
it
just
for
the
comedy
of
watching
sonny
aaron
and
myself
figure
out
the
finer
details
of
giant
tent
building
much
easier
with
camels
i
m
certain
or
simply
going
back
to
my
first
point
why
is
it
up
to
to
change
our
minds
but
jesus
who
is
says
to
make
disciples
of
all
nations
doesn
t
really
make
sense
unencumbered
they
cannot
be
the
killings
did
not
stop
after
the
elections
in
fact
crime
and
violence
soared
in
all
provinces
of
the
country
at
such
an
alarming
rate
that
temporary
ballistic
labs
were
established
as
a
matter
of
urgency
in
all
provinces
except
the
free
state
i
suppose
nelson
mandela
s
decision
to
release
thousands
of
criminals
from
jail
was
a
most
likely
reason
why
crime
soared
to
new
groundbreaking
or
should
i
say
revolutionary
heights
i

at

a
very

it

about

supposedly
when
all

those

were
over
here
in
those
secret

they
were
in

the

up

all
those

how

you
know

to
stop
how
do
you
know
when

is

and
the
goal
then
shifts
towards
maintaining
poor

don

read

they

anyhoo
i
took
the
week
after
easter
off
as
a
holiday
since
i
had
vacation
time
carried
over
from
2011
that
i
had
to
either
use
or
lose
by
the
end
of
april
i
had
lofty
plans
to
use
that
week
to
get
things
done
yo
file
my
taxes
overhaul
the
apartment
clean
out
the
closets
scrub
every
inch
of
the
bathroom
and
go
through
the
clutter
under
the
sink
get
rid
of
clothing
i
never
wear
maybe
even
sew
a
shower
curtain
since
i
can
t
find
any
i
like
in
the
stores
and
am
currently
making
do
with
only
a
1
49
clear
liner
from
ikea
write
letters
and
maybe
go
for
a
long
drive
across
the
prairie
with
a
friend
her
kids
and
our
cameras
instead
i
came
down
with
a
cold
over
easter
weekend
that
rapidly
turned
into
bronchitis
and
spent
most
of
the
following
week
hidden
behind
mountains
of
wadded
up
kleenex
alternately
sleeping
and
coughing
to
and
beyond
the
point
fun
times
the
apartment
got
a
very
quick
once
over
in
the
panicked
half
hour
between
when
i
got
home
from
shopping
friday
afternoon
and
when
my
two
guests
arrived
for
drinks
and
i
m
glad
that
happened
or
it
wouldn
t
have
gotten
cleaned
at
all
of
course
drinks
turned
out
to
mean
a
few
sips
of
wine
followed
by
the
admission
that
we
were
all
sickish
and
subsequent
switch
to
tea
with
lots
of
honey
and
lemon
in
it
because
we
re
exciting
like
that
there
is
a
fascinating
essay
about
the
first
ten
penguins
here
not
all
the
titles
have
lasted
the
test
of

dashiell
hammett's
 
the
thin

was
one
of
the
next
ten
however
in
response
we
see
david
do
two
things
first
he
retreats
to
his
stronghold
it
is
a
place
of
protection
it
is
a
quiet
place
second
he
inquires
of
it
is
here
that
he
inquires
of
for
the
strategy
to
defeat
his
enemy
reveals
it
to
him
and
he
goes
on
to
defeat
the
philistines
in
fact
david
never
lost
a
battle
because
he
learned
to
inquire
of
for
the
strategy
to
defeat
his
enemies
i
find
it
amazing
how
often
you
see
video
game
publishers
and
moaning
about
used
game
sales
they
make
it
out
to
be
the
worst
thing
in
the
history
of
human
kind
in
fact
it
s
just
a
way
that
common
people
save
money
the
risk
of
having
an

lower
than

the
other
member
of
the
club
has
her
introductory
flashback
episode
and
it
s
done
pretty
well
the
mysteriousness
of
the
school
is
enhanced
and
the
relationship
between
mc
and
yuuko
is
developed
some
more
how
she
died
is
also
explained
a
decent
episode
more
dramatic
than
usual
but
it
works
so
they
figured
what
the
let
s
attack
the
injured
party
although
i
was
uncertain
about
the
cream
cheese
i
was
really
surprised
at
how
well
it
went
with
all
the
other
ingredients
and
the
creaminess
it
added
to
the
sandwich
in
the
end
i
was
stuffed
to
the
brim
and
felt
amazing
for
the
rest
of
the
day
if
you
ever
find
yourself
at
edna
fedya
do
not
hesitate
to
order
this

it
was
amazing
the
inherent
value
of
a

is
that
regardless
of
your
profession
it
gives
you
physical
resources
for
the
various
demands
placed
on
your
professional
and
personal
life
this
is
what
i
have
to
arrange
my
heart
rocks
i
collect
these
the
cat
tends
to
knock
them
ar
around
and
off
the
ledge
and
i
patiently
re
arrange
them
i
hate
not
having
some
sort
of
hair
down
if
it
is
side
swept
bangs
or
whatever
we
have
a
protagonist
nishimi
kaoru
who
s
the
new
kid
at
school
which
in
itself
is
already
hard
enough
but
to
add
onto
his
troubles
he
feels
the
need
to
run
away
to
the
rooftop
whenever
he
s
nervous
though
this
does
sound
a
bit
similar
to
another
anime
of
this
season
tsuritama
which
also
has
a
new
kid
protagonist
who
reacts
strongly
when
nervous
let
me
make
it
clear
that
the
similarities
between
these
two
animes
stop
right
here
while
tsuritama
s
palette
is
bright
and
colorful
sakamichi
no
apollon
sticks
with
soft
muted
colors
that
suit
it
quite
well
as
the
protagonist
himself
is
a
little
negative
and
gloomy
i
have
decided
that
it
is
time
to
honor
my
loyal
fans
customers
and
followers
i
thought
the
best
way
to
do
this
is
to
have
a
giveaway
i
put
together
what
i
think
is
a
great
assortment
of
items
no
i
do
not
think
going
to
church
is
the
litmus
test
for
what
being
a
christ
follower
is
all
about
but
i
do
think
that
a
lot
of
people
are
holding
out
for
jesus
to
be
their
savior
at
death
and
missing
the
point
in
life
most
are
not
missing
church
cuz
they
are
engaging
jesus
in
their
days
elsewhere
passionately
and
do
not
need
this
community
of
faith
as
i
work
with
students
and
families
my
goal
is
not
to
help
them
get
ready
for
death
it
is
to
challenge
and
join
them
in
a
better
way
of
life
that
alters
the
hope
they
have
both
in
this
life
and
the
life
to
come
it
was
so
good
in
fact
that
after
i
said
good
bye
to
kyle
i
steered
the
passat
over
to
tr
egs
i
wanted
to
taste
the
latest
scratch
beer
6
loosely
patterned
on
a
dortmunder
export
i
caught
chris
trogner
just
leaving
and
he
turned
around
and
poured
me
a
beer
he
was
headed
for
the
bank
and
was
willing
to
put
that
off
well
you
know
i
like
exports
and
i
liked
this
beer
quite
a
bit
actually
but
no
it
is
not
precisely
an
export
it
is
got
the
heft
and
the
color
but
it
is
hopped
a
bit
more
like
a
pilsner
i
grabbed
a
big
handful
of
our
hain
expenses
leaflets
and
started
handing
them
out
incredibly
i
count
the
people
waiting
for
info
from
me

10

and
i
need
more

back
to
the
counter
passing
by
the
abusers
and
anti
free

crowd
smiling
away
to
myself
i
cant
help
but
notice
their
frustration
is
rising
at
our
immediate
success

no

for

so
is
mid

my
first
opportunity
to
move
back
to
the
states
from
the
hardware
side
i
really
just
don
t
like
the
fact
that
hd
basically
means
re
buy
everything
you
need
the
hd
television
to
watch
the
hd
shows
if
you
want
to
watch
movies
in
hd
you
better
have
the
blu
ray
player
oh
and
don
t
think
that
is
enough
you
will
need
the
blu
ray
movie
too
so
you
need
to
re
buy
all
your
favorite
movies
just
so
they
look
shinier
the
flow
is
supposed
to
be
smoother
too
since
it
can
process
more
frames
per
second
or
something
all
i
know
is
is
that
when
i
watch
it
in
the
store
it
looks
weird
like
if
the
movie
was
at
1
5x
the
speed
it
s
supposed
to
be
on
they
are
even
doing
it
to
old
movies
that
existed
well
before
hd
reworking
which
i
think
is
even
sillier
these
movies
are
even
worse
for
turning
hd
since
it
doesn
t
really
work
they
just
existed
before
the
technology
so
i
m
not
sure
why
we
bother
blade

and
the
great

do
not

and
maybe
this

with

the

blunder

see
my

essentially
do
what
they
want
to
do
every

some
days
that

getting

and
some
days
it

some

that

other

it
means

it

other

it
means

sometimes
it

by

measure
on
any

day
you
could
look
at
my
kids
and
be
amazed
at
the
depth
and
scope
of
their
interests
and
activities
on
any
other
day
you
could
be
equally
amazed
at
the
amount
of
different
things
they
do
and
on
some
days
you
could
be
astonished
by
the
amount
that
my
children
are
seemingly
not
doing

you
could
easily

if
you
ve
been
reading
this
carefully
you
might
be
able
to
hazard
a
guess
as
to
which
gw
author
i
would
or
would
not
prefer
to
write
the
new
book
and
while
i
really
don
t
want
to
participate
in
the
relentless
bashing
of
certain
authors
some
things
are
indeed
just
silly
let
me
get
it
right
next
time
greedy
bankers
greedy
government
i
want
to
support
my
favorite
charities
and
delight
when
my
work
fills
a
need
when
i
can
help
a
friend
or
relative
it
is
a
blessing
for
both
of
us
usually
did
not
frost
the
cupcakes
with
lots
of
ganache
just
dipped
the
cupcakes
when
the
ganache
is

and
gave
it
a
thin
coat
on

my
husband
does
not
like
too
much
frosting
on
cupcakes
there
are
four
main
characters
an
environmental
lawyer
activist
a
stay
at
home
mother
a
musician
and
a
college
student
each
of
them
has
to
deal
with
the
question
what
kind
of
person
am
i
going
to
be
over
and
over
again
that
old
expression
in
between
a
rock
and
a
hard
place
comes
to
mind
two
of
the
characters
are
primarily
concerned
with
being
good
and
two
of
them
are
primarily
concerned
with
being
autonomous
but
in
the
in
between
there
is
a
world
of
emotional
and
moral
possibility
surely
there
is
no
freer
person
than
a
white
well
educated
wealthy
western
man
but
in
the
person
of
walter
berglund
arguably
the
heart
of
the
novel
there
could
be
no
one
more
weighed
down
by
expectations
obligations
and
compromises
how
happy
i
was
this
weekend
then
to
settle
in
with
inside
out
back
again
the
2011
national
book
award
winner
for
young
people's
literature
it
is
well
it
is
perfect
a
story
told
as
a
child
truly
sees
a
collection
of
free
verse
poems
that
set
the
small
things
the
taste
of
papaya
against
the
big
things
the
consequences
of
an
abrupt
flight
from
home
and
makes
us
feel
deeply
what
it
is
to
lose
everything
that
defines
you
and
what
it
is
to
start
all
over
again

quite
and

and
look

just
like
me
as
i
have
indicated
in
earlier
articles
there
is
a
short
term
benefit
for
the
very
rich
from
an
endless
flow
of
easily
replaceable
cheap
labour
which
forces
down
wage
costs
and
disempowers
the
native
workforce
who
dare
not
strike
or
demand
rights
when
they
know
they
can
be
so
easily
replaces
however
even
the
super
rich
are
now
realising
the
gains
are
short
term
if
there
is
any
satisfaction
to
be
gained
from
this
situation
it
is
contemplating
how
much
money
those
evil
and
cynical
old
men
have
lost
in
migrant
blighted
countries
like
greece
portugal
and
ireland
arthur
and
his
knights
had
to
eat
their
wild
boar
somewhere
i
have
a
round
table
in
my
kitchen
but
it
wouldn
t
seat
many
knights
and
my
siege
perilous
is
a
chair
with
a
wonky
leg
rather
than
a
magical
seat
where
nobody
dares
to
sit
anyway
i
ve
never
seen
the

appear
floating
above
it
in

not

i
ve
decided
not
to
focus
on
the
substance
of
beer
but
the
material
that
plays
a
supporting
role
bottles
coasters
cans
labels
ads
tap
handles
church
keys
hats
t
shirts
tip
trays
glassware
and
signs
have
been
collected
by
fanatics
ever
since
beer
has
been
sold
now
on
to
this
week's
challenge
which
is
right
now
im
fairly
sure
most
people
have
a
phobia
or
are
scared
of
something
in
life
may
it
being
heights
death
spiders
or
scared
of
being
alone
these
are
the
common
ones
but
thats
not
what
im
about
i
have
found
out
that
there
are
some
really
funny
and
right
strange
things
people
are
afraid
of
the
first
one
is
melophobia
the
fear
of
music
how
on
earth
can
someone
have
a
phobia
of
something
that
is
all
around
us
in
commercials
radio
tv
everything
another
is
hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia
which
irronically
is
the
fear
of
long
words
you
can
just
imagaine
someone
sitting
there
going
 
oh
im
scared
of
long
words
i
kno
im
going
to
look
up
what
that
is
called
oh
my
nooooooooooooo
 
ok
the
last
one
ill
give
u
and
it
just
made
me
laugh
because
of
how
it
is
but
its
arachibutyrophobia
or
the
fear
of
getting
peanut
butter
stuck
in
the
roof
of
your
mouth
who
comes
up
with
this
they
are
just
tryin
to
make

give

let
me
have
my
little
pity
party
in
this
post
tyra
banks
announced
this
morning
that
the
america
s
next
top
models
original
judges
have
been
axed
from
her
show
after
18
seasons
the
news
comes
as
a
shock
to
fans
as
miss
j
nigel
barker
and
mr
jay
are
so
beloved
and
have
remained
constant
on
the
panel
even
as
others
have
come
and
gone
janice
dickinson

replaced
by

what
genre
are
you
playing
from
an
early
age
reading
has
been
one
of
my
great
loves
a
passion
i
am
pleased
to
share
with
all
four
of
my
children
it
is
because
of
them
and
only
them
i
am
about
to
embark
on
the
second
of
the
harry
potter
series
not
my
usual
focus
it
is
been
several
months
since
i
breezed
through
the
first
may
even
need
a
refresher
or
possibly
have
wallace
bring
me
up
to
speed
he
seems
to
have
them
all
memorised
as
do
many
other
nine
year
old
boys
i
am
sure
i
have
recently
enjoyed
to
a
mockingbird
again
having
read
it
now
three
times
first
in
year

english
at
the
time
a
refreshing
change
from
the
heavy
going
macbeth
the
three
eggs
i
broke
into
a
bowl
measured
142
grams
i
did
not
want
to
use
another
whole
egg
for
eight
measly
grams
and
i
decided
to
call
it
good
enough
then
i
remembered
that
i
still
had
a
few
of
my
darling
quail
eggs
do
not
worry
folks
the
sell
by
date
is
not
until
march
2
one
petite
quail
egg
put
me
six
grams
over
so
i
scooped
out
a
spoonful
there
150
grams
on
the
dot
my
camera
isn
t
the
best
and
it
got
a
little
damaged
so
quality
is
down
and
level
of
blurriness
is
up
the
depression
was
quite
bad
and
really
it
was
the
patience
of
sarah
kind
words
from
my
dad
plus
various
messages
and
calls
from
people
that
came
in
out
of
the
blue
and
generally
thinking
about
all
the
folks
that
have
been
routing

me

you

it

do
that
and
follow

down

you
see
a
man
talk

him
and
he
explains
he
is
the
real
king
survived
because
the
servant
in

is
deaf
and
did
not
hear

orders
not

is

blah

after
done

the

you
make

your

is
at

by
now
the
harvard
law
professor
argued
she
didn
t
use
her
minority
status
to
get
her
teaching
jobs
and
slammed
her
republican
rival
u
s
sen
scott
brown
for
suggesting
otherwise
i
wish
i
could
say
that
the
zan
gah
stories
are
completely
accurate
but
my
approach
was
not
primarily
archaeological
it
was
humanistic
zan
gah
is
about
courage
brotherhood
and
compassion
among
other
things
were
prehistoric
people
compassionate
i
doubt
it
nevertheless
i
tried
to
be
accurate
where
it
counted
i
researched
slings
and
hand
fishing
i
researched
prehistoric
twins
discovering
that
in
some
early
societies
twins
were
terribly
frightening
and
killed
immediately
and
so
was
the
mother
not
the
father
that
information
was
important
in
the
development
of
my
plot
i
had
never
actually
been
inside
a
cave
so
i
visited
onondaga
one
of
the
world's
great
caves
my
state
of
missouri
is
famous
for
them
and
was
overwhelmed
by
the
experience
i
took
notes
furiously
i
was
the
only
guy
in
the
whole
cave
who
was
taking
notes
some
of
them
appear
almost
verbatim
in
the
first
book

as

a

that
nobody

it

to
have
a

i
was
genuinely
excited
when
sue
informed
me
that
she
was
about
as
high
as
she
wanted
to
go
that
night
and
maybe
in
her
life
so
we
just
waited
patiently
on
the

for
the
rest
of
her
family
gazing
up
at
the

we
would

taking

shots

just
recently
my

nice
cousin
brent
elder
brother
of

scanned
the
originals
of
these

gave

some
men
that
you
don
t
merely
show
up
on
the
big
day
grace
everyone
with
your
presence
and
that
is
all
there
is
to
it
like
major
business
projects
a
wedding
requires
detailed
planning
to
be
a
success
perfect
execution
requires
the
making
of
numerous

plans
to
cover
all
the
what
if

and
possible
detours
that
might
end
up
as

to

according
to

verrastro
however
there
are
those
whose
views
are
that
tourism
will
pick
up
again
this
year
and
that
the
demand
to
visit
the
country
is
still
strong
as
long
as
tourists
believe
that
it
is
safe
to
visit
mustn't
one
i
wanna
rock
these
days
i
get
frustrated
whenever
i
do
experience
intense
anxiety
it
is
like
a
thorn
of
the
flesh
that
keeps
popping
up
i
will
think
i
have
finally
surrendered
my
entire
will
to
and
then
a
long
term
crisis
will
bring
out
the
anxiety
again
i
feel
like
i
failed
the
test
but
just
this
morning
i
found
encouragement
i
was
reading
david's
psalm
which
he
wrote
when
he
fled
from
absalom
psalm
3
and
i
thought
here
is
david
a
man
after
god's
own
heart
the
one
who
defeated
the
giant
goliath
the
one
who
won
many
victories
for
the
israelites
the
one
anointed
with
the
holy
spirit
and
anointed
to
be
king
of
israel
and
he
was
fleeing
for
his
life
eventually
the
lord
lifted
him
up
and
gave
him
the
victory
then
i
thought
of
elijah
who
was
also
used
mightily
by
and
then
fled
for
his
life
because
jezebel
threatened
to
him
and
spoke
to
him
in
a
still
small
voice
there
are
other
examples
of
failures
after
successes
in
the
bible
and
then
the
lord
comes
in
and
saves
them
when
they
cry
out
there
were
many
questions
demanding
answers
and
things
started
getting
difficult
with
great
beers
all
around
both
from
near
and
from
far
how
does
one
differentiate
choices
in
the
absence
of
pockets
deep
enough
to
stock
1
000
beers
or
even
300
p
and
i
have
always
felt
that
mealtime
is
family
time
eating
meals
together
as
a
family
is
important
to
us
and
always
has
been
we
tried
many
things
to
try
and
resolve
this
issue
we
all
played
musical
chairs
around
the
table
trying
to
find
an
arrangement
that
worked
for
c
but
with
only
the
four
of
us
and
the
discovery
that
h's
chewing
bothered
c
too
and
the
table
only
being
so
big
nothing
really
worked
we
tried
playing
music
in
the
background
at
dinner
to
try
and
mask
all
the
chewing
noises
and
that
worked
up
to
a
point
but
c
needed
the
music
to
be
so
loud
that
the
rest
of
us
really
could
not
carry
on
conversations
around
the
table
mealtime
became
a
silent
angry
resentful
time
in
our
family

no

if
it
hasn

been

by
now
it
s
frozen
and
not
getting
done
until

we
re
not
even

looking

snow
and
complete
with
a
repressed
looking
populace
clad
in
large
coats
and
bad
attitudes
so
i
ask
you
what
do
i
write
about
i
ve
got
nothing
the
days
in
pittsburgh
enter
my
mind
there
i
said
it
the
name
junghwa
is
my
middle
name
and
my
korean
name
i
have
been
designing
and
creating
since
i
was
a
little
girl
i
love
sketching
painting
sewing
crafting
pretty
much
anything
that
allows
me
to
create
something
tangible
from
all
the
ideas
in
my
head
i
was
a
certified
medical
assistant
orthopedic
technician
for
several
years
i
really
enjoyed
helping
people
become
well
again
it
gave
me
such
a
feeling
of
satisfaction
but
i
missed
having
a
creative
outlet
so
i
took
a
leap
of
faith
left
my
career
behind
and
started
my
business
in
january
2010
today
i
am
still
happily
working
from
home
full
time
where
i
live
with
my
supportive
husband
and
15
month
old
son
i
work
really
hard
every
day
to
share
my
passion
with
all
of
you
daniel
so
dj
sumbody
how
did
you
get
into
the
music
industry
arriv
hier
it
s
a
funny
place
wakefield
has
the
feel
of
a
run
down
old
northern
industrial
town
which
it
is
but
has
little
gems
of
culture
and
community
which
are
well
worth
a
look
if
you
can
see
past
the
1960s
roads

and
buildings
please
visit
some
of
the
other

and
you
may
find
some
great
inspiration
and
some
new
blog
friends
if
you
have
word
verification
on
it
would
be
great
if
you
turned
it
off
google
does
a
great
job
of
keeping
the
spam
out
a
week
and
a
half
ago
we
had
our
ward
closing
social
at
anna's
house
in
provo
her
parents
were
out
of
town
and
we
watched
some
funny
fhe
videos
and
then
had
treats
and
a
dance
party
with
the
ward
it
was
so
much
fun
afterwards
a
group
of
us
went
to
my
apartment
and
watched
a
movie
two
of
my
roommates
stayed
the
night
with
4
other
girls
at
anna's
house
it
was
about
11
30
when
the
movie
ended
so
i
said
i
thought
it
would
be
funny
if
we
went
and
penny
tapped
or
doorbell
ditched
the
girls
that
stayed
the
night
and
a
lovely
bonus
for
those
who
appreciate
presentation
as
much
as
i
do
they
do
this
in
all
stores
when
you
purchase
a

malone

2

4
cups
fresh
basil
leaves
preferably
young
small
leaves
of
the
genoese
quality
but
i
changed
it
up
a
bit
i
used
fresh
spinach
instead
of
frozen
spinach
and
i
used
fresh
mushrooms
instead
of
canned
mushrooms
i
mean
seriously
why
not
i
used
the
cream
of
chicken
soup
and
i
have
to
say
that
i
have
never
before
done
bread
crumbs
with
melted
butter
to
make
a
crumbly
crust
it
was
delicious
and
so
easy
why
have
i
missed
this
in
the
past
for
hath
concluded
them
all
in
unbelief
that
he
might
have
mercy
upon
all
directed
by
andrew
rossi
who
applies
a
journalistic
fact
gathering
approach
the
film
focuses
on
a
few
individuals
that
give
the
paper
its
essence
today
one
of
those
is
david
carr
a
former
drug
addict
who
turned
his
life
around
at
the
age
of
31
and
has
become
one
of
the
paper's
finest
reporters
carr
has
a
unique
sense
of
humor
to
say
the
least
he
is
self
deprecating
but
he
is
also
ready
to
pounce
on
someone
who
makes
fun
of
him
or
his
paper
at
times
he
comes
across
as
a
smart
know
it
all
but
in
the
final
analysis
he
is
very
loyal
to
his
friends
and
his
bosses
and
is
one
helluva
reporter
and
writer
my
favourite
drink
is
getting
too
expensive
these
days
to
be
playing
beery
russian
roulette
with
my
next
pint
not
knowing
whether
it
will
be
in
awesome
awful
or
just
alright
condition
i
know
the
cask
marque
system
of
accreditation
exists
as
an
indicator
of
a
pub
that
serves
well
kept
beer
and
the
nature
of
beer
as
a
living
product
means
that
it
will
change
in
the
cask
but
sometimes
there
is
no
excuse
for
sloppy
cellarcraft

every
time
i
said
opinion
on
something
like
my
personal
opinion
i
know
i
was
18
all
my
opinions
weren
t
great
or
ideal
they
weren
t
flawless
for
every
single
opinion
of
mine
he
didn
t
say
or
so
he
tried
to
push
me
his
opinion
like
if
his
opinion
was
better
and
he
used
to
say
i
have
limited
perspective
so
that
was
that
fully
do
we
do
that
these
days
i
don
t
think
we
even
set
our
hope
partially
on
the
redeeming
life
that
is
promised
to
us
and
given
to
us
by
through
his
son
jesus
christ
not
in
the
desires
of
our
hearts
and
not
in
the
actions
of
our
daily
lives
maybe
and
that
s
a
big
maybe
we
attempt
that
on
sundays
with
the
words
of
our
mouths
just
paying
lip
service
to
that
hope
that
is

my
best

never

side
thanks
for
stopping
by
to
see
my
project
diesel
prices
are
the
highest
of
all
and
most
farm
tractors
that
i
am
familiar
with
operate
on
diesel
so
do

that
transport
our
goods
so
do
most
of
the
cargo

that
haul

i
was
layin
 
round
town
in
a
house
of
ill
fame
i
was
going
to
have
a
boy
clothing
yard
sale
but
the
fates
did
not
align
as
planned
so
that
s
been
pushed
back
to
next
week
instead
we
hit
up
the
parade
on
a
whim
okay
so
apparently
the
lawrence
st
patty
s
day
parade
when
it
lands
on
a
weekend
is
not
something
you
do
on
a
whim
we
headed
downtown
about
half
an
hour
early
drove
around
trying
to
find
parking
for
almost
20
minutes
then
scott
dropped
off
pete
and
i
and
went
to
find
parking
on
his
own
he
finally
found
a
spot
nine
blocks
from
where
we
ended
up
yeah
so
anyway
we
had
a
good
time
and
i
was
super
duper
thankful
to
finally
see
my
husband
again
after
he
found
us
because
wooooooo
boy
but
i
had
no
idea
how
heavy
pete
was
until
i
had
to
hold
him
on
my
shoulders

period
of
longer
than
2
minutes

i
must
say
i
have
been
battling
with
a
few
issues
for
quite
some
time
now
say
almost
since

a
read
a
very
thought
provoking
blog
this
week
by
michael
hait
at
planting
the
seeds
titled
the
genealogy
paradigm
shift
are
bloggers
the
new
experts
michael
discusses
how
geneabloggers
are
becoming
viewed
as
something
akin
to
experts
in
the
field
of
genealogy
he
also
points
out
the
lagging
membership
of
genealogy
societies
the
importance
of
an
online
presence
and
support
of
these
local
societies
there
were
a
lot
of
very
interesting
points
made
in
the
article
it
is
insightful
and
i
think
it
is
a
great
read
and
it
is
style
central
which
i
adore
i
could
spend
a
full
day
gazing
at
the
deliciously
styled
shop
windows
and
taking
in
the
incredible
street
fashion
while
sipping
a
caf
au
lait
at
one
of
the
many
bistros
that
dot
the
champs
lys
es
as
it
happens
that
book
isn
t
the
only
paranormal
work
of
fiction
that
i
have
had
fond
memories
of
a
few
years
after
first
reading
devi
i
watched
the
x
files
for
the
first
time
i
think
it
was
early
1994
i
hadn
t
started
university
yet
and
came
home
from
addabazi
quite
late
one
night
everyone
at
home
had
gone
to
sleep
and
i
wasn
t
sleepy
i
switched
on
the
tv
and
saw
couple
of
fbi
agents
investing
some
weird
stuff
in
an
arctic
scientific
facility
i
was
hooked
so
if
i
am
missing
i
am
in
action

darlene
pavlick
gets
an
extra
entry
i
already
have
gone
accepted
the
fact
that
book
adapted
movies
are
going
to
be
different
but
in
the
case
of
thg
i
was
very
sad
and
disappointed
that
they
changed
the
part
where
madge
were
supposed
to
give
the
mockingjay
pin
to
katniss
i
think
that
part
is
one
of
the
essential
parts
in
the
book
2
handfuls
of
fresh
mint
leaves
picked
what
then
of
the
theory
about
the
people's
war
numerous
submissions
to
the
trc
had
detailed
the
role
in
violence
of
the
 
armed
struggle
 
especially
after
it
had
evolved
in
the
1980s
into
what
the
anc
termed
a
 
people's
war
 
the
people's
war
explicitly
targeted
not
only
policemen
and
soldiers
but
also
local
councillors
 
collaborators
 
 
informers
 
and
all
 
puppets
and
agents
of
the
regime
 
the
aim
of
the
people's
war
was
to
render
south
africa
 
ungovernable
 
and
ultimately
overthrow
all
authority
but
because
it
relied
on
the
masses
to
mount
an
insurrection
rather
than
on
trained
guerrillas
to
fight
the
police
and
army
the
violence
it
generated
spiralled
out
of
control
and
because
it
targeted
so
many
in
the
black
community
it
also
provoked
a
violent
backlash
from
some
at
least
once
the
retaliation
began
moreover
it
developed
its
own
momentum
and
among
other
consequences
evolved
into
a
civil
war
between
the
anc
and
the
ifp
that
spread
in
time
from
natal
and
kwazulu
to
the
reef
i
see
them
as
integrated
into
my
life
and
as
part
of
me
but
i
don
t
give
them
my
heart
i
give
my
mind
to
them
and
my
body
but
my
emotions
they
are
so
secondary
in
most
of
my
experience
that
they
aren
t
really
something
that
i
either
can
or
feel
is
appropriate
to
give
there
are
so
many

the
internet
engines

is
going
somewhere
great
let's
go
with
this
is
her
age
in
babylonian
symbols
i
was
going
to
reveal
how
old
she
was
but
then
again
she
did
not
on
her
blog
so
the
cat
shall
remain
in
the
bag
unless
you
are
fluent
in
babylonian
you
will
never
know
i
would
also
ask
yourself
what
is
it
about
walking
down
the
aisle
you
don
t
like
or
want
to
avoid
if
it
s
the
attention
then
skip
the
wedding
and
elope
because
as
the
bride
and
groom
all
eyes
will
be
on
you
all
night
long
last
week
was
debbie
corbari's
birthday
i
know
you
have
not
met
her
but
she
is
the
amazing
talented
artist
who
draws
a
lot
of
our
awesome
stamp
sets
i
love
her
she
is
also
a
wonderful
friend
of
mine
we
have
a
very
fun
new
release
on
the
way
over
at
the
ocl
blog
we
shared
some
birthday
cards
that
were
made
for
her
i
thought
i'd
share
them
here
with
you
since
mot
carries
all
these
stamp
sets
and
it
might
just
inspire
you
as
it
did
me
over
the
years
it
has
become
commonplace
for
circle
visitors
to
experience
an
energetic
flow
within
its
precinct
video
cameras
malfunction
batteries
suddenly
go
dead
compasses
fluctuate
wildly
the
electromagnetic
field
which
circles
produce
has
been
likened
by
some
dowsers
empaths
and
sensitives
to
the
static
they
feel
inside
the
oldest
stone
circles
again
it
seems
synchronistic
that
the
crop
circles
and
the
stone
circles
of
wiltshire
and
north
britain
share
a
mystical
connection
in
location
effect
on
ground
water
and
subsoil
samples
taken
for
scientific
analysis
by
non
profit
agencies
such
as
blt
research
confirm
this
in
1980
the
dragon
project
measured
a
miraculous
surge
of
radiation
within
the
precinct
of
rollright
stones
oxon
at
the
moment
of
sunrise
stonehenge
visitors
for
midsummer
sunrise
confirm
similar
rises
in
energy
both
these
stone
circles
are
reasonably
complete
in
construction
by
contrast
dowsers
who
have
visited
restored
stone
circles
a
notorious
one
in
aberdeenshire
at
strichen
experience
sickness
and
have
to
leave
because
of
the
disruptive
energy
fields
created
by
misaligned
or
substituted
stones
of
the
wrong
geological
composition
it
seems
our
neolithic
ancestors
had
a
sense
of
knowing
where
to
place
stone
circles
on
the
earth
s
electromagnetic
nodes
and
within
widely
electrically
conductive
aquifers
of
chalk
or
limestone
it
worked
like
a
dream
no
crafting
done
this
week
but
maybe
tomorrow
for
the
past
three
decades
the
uk
has
had
a
completely
relaxed
attitude
about
selling
off
its
assets
to
companies
based
abroad
indeed
most
of
the
time
the
swallowing
up
of
yet
another
great
british
institution
barely
makes
a
headline
william
shakespeare
s
tragedy
hamlet
focused
around
a
young
procrastinator
often
erroneously
labeled
a
tragic
hero
the
young
prince
was
really
a
mundane
scholar
very
average
in
his
capabilities
the
most
banal
perpetrator
in
the
shakespearean
canon
aristotle
once
wrote
that
in
good
drama
we
learn
about
the
character
through
their
actions
and
not
their
speech
shakespeare
turns
the
notion
on
its
head
and
has
hamlet
waffle
on
about
spirituality
and
philosophy
when
he
s
supposed
to
be
avenging
his
father
s
death
being
a
complete
neophyte
to
the
genre
i
am
loathe
to
rate
this
novel
whether
for
its
entertainment
or
literary
value
believing
that
what
i
have
written
above
must
suffice
for
my
response
to
this
high
quality
work
however
it
i
were
given
no
choice
other
than
to
summarize
my
response
in
a
number
or
to
take
a
bullet
in
the
head
my
ignorance
be
dammed
i
surely
would
give
this
novel
four
stars
out
of
a
possible
five

mellow
first
you
cook
the
chicken
and
put
it
off
to
the
side
i
wipe
out
the
pan
and
start
again
with
the
oil
i
put
all
the
veggies
except
the

in
the

and
continue
to
stir
it

they
become

mushy
then
i
add

pretty

i
throw
in

then
i
add
some

i

stir

in

that

are

rather
those
of

listen
the
film's
visual
emphasis
is
confirmed
right
from
its
extraordinary
opening
sequence
in
which
it
takes
nearly
ten
minutes
for
anyone
to
say
a
word
instead
rollin
simply
delivers
one
mysterious
outrageous
set
piece
after
another
cult
scientists
in
red
hoods
a
girl
wearing
a
similar
hood
and
inject
her
with
color
coded
chemicals
that
drip
into
beakers
around
the
lab
the
bright
chemicals
look
like
dyes
prepared
for
easter
eggs
more
than
scientific
solutions
but
no
matter
the
pacing
is
slow
almost
narcotized
and
rollin
cuts
between
steady
silent
closeups
the
red
hooded
men
their
eyes
peering
out
through
thin
ragged
slits
in
their
cloth
hoods
the
beakers
and
scientific
equipment
around
the
room
the
girl's
eyes
peering
out
from
behind
her
own
hood
in
the
next
scene
a
girl
caroline
cartier
in
a
gauzy
orange
dress
beneath
the
thin
translucent
material
runs
through
the
darkness
pursued
by
men
in
animal
masks
this
sequence
is
evocative
and
beautiful
and
creepy
the
girl
and
her
pursuers
casting
elongated
shadows
on
the
blank
walls
of
the
buildings
rollin
making
excellent
use
of
wide
expanses
of
negative
space
with
the
girl
trapped
between
these
monstrous
shadow
creatures
the
deliberate
pacing
only
adds
to
the
creepiness
of
it
all
with
rollin
frequently
cutting
in
inscrutable
closeups
of
the
men
in
their
gaudy
sinister
masks
turns
out
i
m
not
as
familiar
with
them
as
i
thought
for
instance
whenever
i
thought
of
the
mahabharata
i
always
had
this
vague
idea
that
the
story
was
about
the
fratricidal
war
between
the
pandavas
and
the
kauravas
and
the
politics
behind
it
all
but
there
is
so
much
more
to
it
there
are
hundreds
of
characters
each
with
his
or
her
fascinating
back
story
and
motivation
so
many
little
incidents
that
happen
generations
before
the
actual
war
actually
make
that
event
inevitable

according

take

it

my

going
regarding

a

to
be
an
acknowledgement
that

cook
the

and
tomatoes
separately
then
mix
them
together
this
is
my
preferred
method
too
most
people
like
to
cook
the
egg
first
then
the
tomatoes
but
i
like
to
do
the
reverse
i
find
cooking
the
eggs
first
if
it
is
still
soft
the
egg
will
set
to
a
large

when
adding
to
the
cooked
tomatoes

how

he
brings
a
unique
and
different
perspective
to
this
project
from
the
inside
out
thanks
for
taking
the
time
to
contribute
your
observations
for
instance
onam
a
kerala
festival
is
an
official
holiday
here
cow
slaughter
is
allowed
earlier
it
was
banned
there
is
a
disregard
for
local
festivals
and
local
shrines
are
going
bankrupt
the
time
of
day
matters
too
the
harsh
light
of
day
may
not
be
the
most
flattering
but
certain
times
of
the
day
may
not
be
so
great
either
if
there
s
strong
contrast
from
trees
or
foliage
overhead
with
hot
spots
from
the
sun
mixed
with
shade
form
the
leaves
and

most
of
the
time
early
morning
or
late
afternoon

best
cloudy
foggy
or
misty
days
can
also
provide
good
light
for
photographing
waterfalls
but
talking
to
people
checking
out
the
falls
and
otherwise
doing
research
is
best
particularly
if
you
re
visiting
figure
out
when
the
light
looks
the
best
or
the
most
dramatic
popular
places
like

often
have

i
told

that
this

it

i
was

removed

to
let
this
actually
matter
to
me
i
did
not
even
bring

well
i
am
not

i
wouldn

have
known
anything
about

had
it
not
been
for

sally

generously
sharing
the
information
that
she
d
sold
on
some
of
her
previously
published

to

i

her
in

now
i

like
to
acknowledge
in

how
much
in

i
am
thanks
sally
and
i
owe
you
i
hadn
t
heard
much
about
the
hunger
games
certainly
not
at
all
when
the
books
first
came
out
a
couple
of
months
before
the
movie
released
i
heard
the
odd
thing
someone
read
the
books
someone
else
asked
for
a
gist
of
the
story
from
what
i
overheard
i
thought
it
sounded
like
a
book
i
read
a
long
time
ago
called
the
long
walk
by
richard
bachman
an
alias
belonging
to
stephen
king
a
similar
premise
in
some
ways
but
it
turned
out
to
be
very
very
different
it
s
supposed
to
be
may
no
really
it
is

can
also
read

in

and
add
the
milk
mixture
and
egg
mix
with
a
wooden
spoon
then
with
your
hands
then
remove
from
the
bowl
and
begin
to
knead
i
still
found
it
overly
sticky
but
my
egg
was
very
large
so
i
added
small
amounts
of
flour
gradually
until
the
dough
was
workable
knead
for
about
5mins
and
then
put
into
a
lightly
oiled
bowl
cover
with
a
clean

for
about
an
hour

came
to

just
before

amber
still
was
crying
almost
non

nurses
had
taken
her
out
of
my
room
to
try
calm
her
but
no
way
was
that
happening
in
the
end
my
no

nurse
expressed
off
me
and
gave
it
to
her
with
a
syringe
then
pushed
her
bed
into
a
corner
wrapped
her
up
tight
and
said
to
leave
her
to
cry

goes

route
that
i
ran
2
weeks

we
meant
to
run
all
10
miles
but
it
was
a
hot
day
and
we
got
a
little
lost
so
we
cut
the
run
short
not
to
make
any
excuses
but
the
stats
below
don
t
really
reflect
that
i
ran
this
route
faster
than
last
time
if
you
take
out
the
0
4
miles
where
we
were
wandering
around
lost
on
rough
trails
before
we

turn

missing

you

make

it

happen
rarely

at

story
about
mastic

smoking
bacon
rind
the
russian
speaker
gave
the
strangest
presentation
he
had
a
girl
stand
next
to
him
at
the
podium
a
young
blond
with
a
big
smile
and
her
job
was
to
press
the
button
for
the
next
slide
never
mind
that
his
hand
was
closer
to
the
keyboard
than
she
was
or
that
he
had
to
interrupt
himself
to
say
 
next
slide
please
 
every
time
then
there
was
his
talk
itself
he
would
go
a
minute
or
two
without
changing
the
slide
speaking
in
a
very
heavy
accent
but
the
slides
did
not
contain
anything
to
help
us
understand
what
was
going
on
there
were
no
diagrams
or
explanations
just
graphs
of
data
that
must
have
been
explained
in
the
flow
of
words
but
who
could
follow
at
one
point
a
chart
said
that
107
of
the
cells
were
dead
wow
they
are
good
these
russian
scientists

i
am
odd
again
now
all
we
needed
were

i
now
know
more
about
the
history
of
the
48th
highlanders
and
more
about
my
husband's
great
uncle
jack
who
served
as
bandmaster
for
50
years
the
problems
of
the
university
like
the
problems
of
the
world
are
only
more
likely
to
be
solved
by
conversation
than
not
here
it
is
the
top
ten
reasons
i
have
not
been
blogging
i
turn
to

under
the
title

it
has
won
a
numerous
public

every
religion
of
the
past
had
an
occult
side
which
had
custody
of
mysteries
and
initiations
that
were
sought
by
eminent
men
of
their
time
most
of
these
ancient
religions
profess
to
be
custodians
of
a
gnosis
divine
knowledge
per
se
lately
i
have
been
doing
a
lot
of
painting
the
custom
portraits
from
my
etsy
shop
seem
to
be
my
most
popular
item
i
have
been
working
on
a
few
as
well
as
some
other
stuff
and
that
is
why
i
have
not
been
posting
much
i
will
post
pictures
of
the
one
i
am
working
on
now
i
am
really
liking
how
it

i
have
decided
to
post
a
tiny
bit
from
my
upcoming
novel
however
this
is
still
under
revision
and
may
change
a
bit
from
what
i
post
here
the
scene
is
one
of
many
zombie
pov
situations
that
i
include
in
my
story
but
let
me
be
clear
the
whole
novel
does
not
revolve
around
the
zombie
i
am
featuring
here
she
only
represents
one
of
the
characters
in
my
book
although
she
does
play
an
important
role
to
the
story
and
here
it
goes
picking
your
toolbox
quite
simply
i
would
love
this
and
the
best
part
is
they
even
ship
internationally
caldwell
a
cold
well
more
pepsi
machines
bubbles
risin
 
from
his
feet
maya
heart
pins
i
reiterate
our
call
for
inter
alia
the
immediate
ending
of
the
state
of
emergency
and
the
freeing
of
all
and
not
only
some
political
prisoners
cruising
homeward
but
what
it
also
did
was
cause
me
to
think
of
the
spiritual
principle
our
dogs
illustrated
their
food
bowls
were
empty
and
had
been
empty
for
quite
some
time
both
buddy
and
duke
are
strays
we
rescued
so
they
had
been
on
their
own
before
yet
they
stayed
why
did
they
stay
and
not
go
wandering
to
at
least
look
for
food
because
of
loyalty
and
also
a
form
of
faith
deep
inside
them
faith
that
we
loved
them
and
would
always
take
care
of
them
now
i
know
they
are
only
dogs
and
don
t
display
the
higher
cognitive
thinking
abilities
we
humans
have
but
there
is
a
core
deep
inside
them
a
trust
and
faithfulness
that
we
should
all
make
note
of
so
was
sober
enough
to
peel
the
sprouts
myself
wea
re
to
sit
comfortably
with
eyes
closed
whilst
kate
our
cardio
nurse
talks
us
through
a
scenario
which
we
are
to
imagine
i
remember
mama
lighting
the
menorah
i
could
tell
you
sponsorship
and
pro
bono
horror
stories
all
day
long
i
worked
over
100
hours
raising
money
for
an
organizations
in
the
past
and
today
they
pretend
not
to
know
me
you
can
probably
guess
how
that
makes
me
feel
you
can
probably
also
guess
why
i
have
stopped
conversing
with
them
and
i
do
not
attend
their
events
for
another
group
i
invested
400
out
of
my
pocket
to
keep
their
club
afloat
when
i
was
a
teaching
assistant
in
grad
school
400
was
almost
half
of
my
monthly
stipend
the
response
i
got
was
we
did
not
care
about
you
anyways
i
do
not
even
pay
dues
to
them
anymore
and
i
have
been
approached
numerous
times
about
why
i
left
the
group
it
does
not
take
a
psychologist
to
guess
how
i
feel
about
them
now
i
have
no
sympathy
for
groups
who
behave
in
such
rude
ways
onto
you
soup
also
imagine
the
tree
of
vessels
in
who
by
repentance
is
not
satisfied
 
let
my
guitar
playing
friend
do
my
request
 
let
him
shahrukh
who
had
landed
in
the
us
to
visit
the
yale
university
was
detained
at
the
airport
for
two
long
hours
though
he
was
later
released
the
incident
provoked
almost
a
mini
war
between
the
us
and
india
enraged
by
the
event
the
indian
government
along
with
many
bollywood
celebrities
expressed
their
rage
and
disapproval
through
various
media
what
is
beauty
after
my
trip
today
i
know
what
is
it
not
real
beauty
has
nothing
to
do
with
our
bodies
or
what
we
look
like
on
the
outside
it
just
can
t
be
because
i
am
the
same
person
i
was
in
the
garden
except
that
now
i
don
t
look
the
same
it
is
a
dangerous
thing
to
be
swayed
by
something
that
looks
pleasing
on
the
outside
and
by
the
way
it
was
not
an
apple
is
just
says
fruit
i
do
not
know
how
this
whole
apple
thing
got
started
i
play
agent
bothwick
a
colleague
of
fdr
and
tuck
within
the
cia
who
gets
drafted
onto
fdr
s
chris
pine
s
team
in
the
war
against
tuck
tom
hardy
bothwick
is
fdr
s
right
hand
man
so
to
speak
and
does
a
lot
of
the
technical
work
when
it
comes
to
spying
on
researching
and
sabotaging
tuck
in
his
pursuit
of
romantic
relations
with
lauren
reese
witherspoon
he
s
a
consummate
professional
in
the
beginning
but
he
evolves
into
a
bit
of
a
comedic
sidekick
we
see
quite
a
bit
of
him
in
the
film
and
he
i
got
to
deliver
a
couple
of
pretty
funny
lines
tuck
had
his
own
cia
sidekick
agent
boyles
played
by
the
very
funny
kevin
o
grady
but
i
tell
you
what
worried
me
most
about
minimalism
one
blog
suggested
that
one
should
even
be
minimalist
in
one's
conversations
to
weigh
each
word
and
only
have
meaningful
communications
with
other
people
that
my
dahlings
you
will
not
be
surprised
to
hear
frightened

life

it

of
my

alan

from

that

with
what
has
to
be
the
most
hassle
free
method
around
for
me
one
of
the
highlights
of
the
day
was
getting
a
chocolate
soft
serve
on
the
way
out
i'd
been
craving
one
for
months
 
hope
springs
eternal
 
shortly
after
noon
they
had
reached
a
height
of
around
2000
feet
above
the
river
and
exhausted
thirsty
and
soaking
wet
from
the
high
humidity
found
themselves
at
a
tiny
grass
covered
hut
the
two
farmers
who
lived
in
the
hut
melquiades
richarte
and
anacleto
alvarez
welcomed
their
grateful
visitors
with
a
meal
of
sweet
potatoes
and
gourds
filled
with
refreshing
water
the
farmers
explained
that
there
were
numerous
terraces
in
the
vicinity
upon
which
they
could
grow
their
crops
and
that
they
were
also
nicely
hidden
away
from
any
undesirable
visitors
on
the
look
out
for
taxes
or
volunteers
for
the
army
my
now
abbreviated
life
in
recent
months
photographs
and
videos
have
captured
scenes
of
violence
and
brutality
against
peaceful
gatherings
these
have
embarrassed
the
perpetrators
of
the
violence
and
those
behind
them
only
a
few
days
ago
a
mob
attacked
the
peaceful
occupy
dataran
encampment
among
those
targeted
were
those
activists
wielding
cameras
or
smart
phones
ostensibly
in
a
bid
to
thwart
any
attempt
to
document
the
violence
and
identify
the
perpetrators
leading
up
to
the
bersih
rally
branches
represent
your
body
if
you
are
like
a
tree
planted
by
rivers
this
age
is
i
know
just
a
precursor
to
the
teen
years
to
come
as
frustrating
as
certain
moments
can
be
i
treasure
this
time
yes
he
is
half
grown
but
if
the
glimpses
that
i
see
of
the
man
he
may
become
prove
true
he
will
grow
to
be
a
man
of
worth
that
is
what
i
hope
someday
to
see
and
while
the
food
photos
in
this
book
certainly
look
delicious
many
of
them
remind
me
of
why
i
pay
to
eat
at
a
restaurant
in
the
first
place
stuffed
squid
with
ratatouille
polenta
fries
and
balsamic
butter
from
the
garden
sounds
delicious
it
also
sounds
like
something
i
would
burn
overpay
for
and
ultimately
make
me
wish
i
had
gotten
take
out
instead
in
trying
to
show
themselves
off
many
of
the
recipes
given
by
these
restaurants
are
not
only
complicated
but
involve
expensive
ingredients
when
i
entered
college
i
didn
t
go
with
the
delusional
belief
that
work
would
be
waiting
for
me
when
i
got
out
i
didn
t
want
to
study
something
practical
because
that
s
not
what
college
is
for
to
me
to
me
i
went
to
college
to
be
exposed
to
intellectual
pursuits
to
learn
for
the
sake
of
learning
no
sane
person
majors
in
media
studies
or
communication
thinking
that
they
will
be
handed
a
high
paying
job
for
their
trouble
at
least
no
thoughtful
or
reflective
person
thinks
that
smelling
the
rich
thawed
female
land
pungent
i
still
could
not
resist
putting
pretty
orchids
at
the
top
of
this
post
a
k
a
this
is
a
sucky
thing
i
feel
i
have
been
treated
ill
allowed
myself
to
be
tricked
used
i
have
been
a
fool
we
have
worked
hard
to
cut
back
on
all
our
spending
yet
i
have
offered
up
our
resources
unnecessarily
but
this
is
not
an
insurmountable
thing
everything
anything
could
so
easily
be
much
worse
live
and
learn
i
get
more
chances
today
is
a
new
day
and
like
anne
of
green
gables
would
say
it
does
not
have
any
mistakes
in
it
yet
and
i
do
not
take
simple
things
like
movement
my
ability
to
walk
or
dance
when
i
can
dance
without
feeling
sick
for
granted
anymore
it
is
a
fine
and
remarkable
thing
to
be
able
to
move
about
the
world
last
note
this
is
an
excellent
way
to
hide
veggies
for
the
kids
and
adults
alike
you
can
put
them
in
the
sauce
and
just
blend
it
all
up
then
add
in
enough
meat
and
they
ll
never
know
i
tried
this
on
my
friend
s
10
year
old
son
and
it
worked
like
a
charm
also
tried
it
on
a
guy
i
dated
years
ago
who
claimed
to
hate
veggies
worked
on
him
too
gotta
love
the
sneaky

informed
depending
on
how
most
people
feel
about
recaps
sometimes
they
can
be
a
helpful
refresher
of
what
happened
in
the
series
thus
far
or
it
can
be
an
irritating
break
from
the
main
story
when
all
you
want
to
do
is
keep
watching
until
the
end
lauren
says
despite
the
fact
that
we
have
been
inspired
by
song
titles
all
year
long
when
i
sat
down
to
make
a
specifically
music
influenced
card
my
mind
went
totally
blank
then
i
did
what
i
always
do
when
i
am
stumped
i
went
foraging
through
my
stash
of
vintage
stuff
within
five
minutes
i
had
the
sheet
music
and
a
plan
within
another
five
i
had
found
the
gorgeous
victorian
postcard
on
t'internet
and
printed
it
out
not
long
after
that
i
was
done
i
love
it
when
a
plan
comes
together
i
am
sure
most
of
you
have
heard
that
the
national
wildlife
federation
promoters
of
the
backyard
habitat
certification
program
have
partnered
with
scotts
of
miracle
gro
and
fertilizer
and
insecticide
fame
two
programs
are
key
increasing
wild
songbirds
by
buying
scotts
birdseed
and
getting
kids
back
out
into
nature
where
they
can
absorb
all
kinds
of
scotts
products
i
apologize
for
my
snark
go
read
tallamy's
bringing
nature
home
and
louv's
last
child
in
the
woods
that
is
all
you
need
to
light
a

years
after
leaving

dedicated
to
the
challenges
of
his
internal
spiritual
self
development
guided
by
the
teachings
of
bhagavad
gita
as
it
is
by
his
divine
grace
a
c
bhaktivedanta
swami
prabhupada
in
the
year
1990
he
took
up
the
challenge
of
building
one
of
today
s
most
popular
cultural
and
spiritual
centers
a
landmark
destination
in
bangalore
the
iskcon
sri
radha
krishna
temple
starting
with
practically
nothing
from
a
fledging
two
room
rented
premises
he
built
and
led
a
team
of
selfless
volunteers
in
what
can
be
considered
as
one
of
india
s
largest
fundraising
efforts
of
those
days
to
set
up
this
cultural
monument
at
a
cost
of
over
rs
40
crores
on
a
seven
acres
plot
in
the
heart
of
bangalore
city
it
was
inaugurated
in
1997
by
the
then
president
of
india
the
successful
completion
of
this
project
was
due
his
applying
his
training
in
iit
on
a
foundation
of
spiritual
maturity
for
a
selfless

to

as
if
it
was
not
bad
enough
that
we'd
only
met
four
times
and
here
i
was
living
in
her
house
practically
engaged
to
her

i
had
to
go
rub
our
life
in
her
face
before
she'd
even
had
time
to
wake
up
take
care
my
friends
and
have
a
blessed
and
relaxing
evening
it
s
a
good
tune
on
top
of
a
hard
sample
of
a
harder
tune
when
a
friend
of
mine
about
a
month
and
a
bit
ago
dropped
this
tune
for
me
i
went
absolutley
wild
it
s
only
a
year
since
i
used
to
absolutely
murda
linval
thompson
s
ode
to
cannabis
i
love
marijuana
everything
that
you
have
always
dreamed
of
we
are
lucky
in
that
is
great
at
sport
and
hope
that
he
can
use
this
as
an
outlet
to
help
get
through
school
without
sticking
out
as
the
clever
one
or
the
nerd
it
was
how
maddad
managed
his
intelligence
and
maybe
and
one
day
mini
can
do
the
same
i
did
find
a
few
of
white
and
ecru
dmc
cebelia
at
a
hancocks
fabric
store
so
picked
up
a
ball
of
size
30
in
white
then
stopped
at
a
micheal's
store
and
found
a
few
colors
of
dmc
perle
cotton
so
picked
up
a
ball
of
white
and
a
ball
of
red
in
size

now
is
the
time
for
all
good

i
don
t
know
the
trip
home
was
good
fun
and
3
weeks
went
by
so
so
fast
and
i
am
kicking
myself
for
not
staying
on
for
some
more
time
its
strange
how
a
country
and
its
ways
just
grow
on
you
and
you
head
to
the
place
you
called
home
only
to
find
their
ways
annoying
i
had
a
couple
of
epiphanies
after
i
got
home
care
to
read
it
is
a
cunning
line
based
on
the
reported
words
of
rupert
murdoch
in
the
wall
street
journal
earlier
this
week
murdoch
referring
to
news
corp's
handling
of
the
crisis
since
it
broke
said
they'd
handled
it
well
with
only
and
few
minor
mistakes
i
have
now
seen
this
has
been
reinterpreted
by
some
bbc
reporters
and
labour
politicians
including
john
prescott
so
far
as
meaning
the
accusations
against
the
news
of
the
world
such
as
the
accessing
of
milly
downler's
voicemails
were
minor
mistakes
clever
there
will
be
many
that
may
disagree
that
news
corp
have
handled
the
crisis
well
with
only
a
few
minor
mistakes
but
no
one
would
agree
that
the
accusations
regarding
the
accessing
of
innocent
private
individuals
 
voicemails
including
victims
of
crime
are
minor
mistakes
indeed
it
is
a
line
that
had
he
actually
said
it
would
add
to
the
public
outrage
and
focus
it
more
sharply
on
rupert
murdoch
himself
which
is
of
course
their
agenda
by
my
estimates
i
should
have
close
to
350
000
words
done
on
the
book
not
the
original
430
000
word
count
deadline
i
imposed
on
myself
so
loftily
late
last
month
and
on
twitter
during
recent
years
i
have
maintained
a
habit
of
taking
time
out
there
are
thousands
of
new
books
published
every
year
and
a
very
small
number
are
reviewed
many
books
that
come
out
just
do
not
survive
very
long
on
the
shelves
of
bookstores
a
year
ago
today
we
found
out
we
were
expecting
our
sweet
girl
from
page
77
starting
with
line
7
the
church
is
s
vision
of
united
mankind
a
union
achieved
through
the
gift
of
and
not
by
human
effort
it
is
a
union
which
maintains
a
diversity
of
sorts
the
languages
do
not
become
one
super
language
so
much
for
the
unity
of
latin
but
a
diversity
whose
unity
is
found
in
true
union
with
the
one
living
and
true
the
gospel
proclaimed
by
the
apostles
on
the
day
of
pentecost
though
preached
in
many
languages
was
one
and
the
same
gospel
why
am
i
so
interested
in
all
things
gypsy
in
3
months
time
i
will
be
travelling
to
slovakia
via
the
uk
and
vienna
i
will
be
joining
a
team
which
includes
youth
from
czech
members
of
a
local
slovak
church
and
gypsy
christians
in
cooperation
with
the
local
government
we
will
be
clearing
an
illegal
dump
and
cleaning
up
other
areas
of
the
village
the
project
slogan
is
i
love
my
city
we
believe
that
this
initiative
is
an
opportunity
for
the
roma
often
seen
as
a
curse
in
a
community
to
be
seen
as
a
blessing
despite
these
achievements
in
toning
down
the
official
air
force
doctrine
of
mutually
assured
destruction
mad
few
at
rand
were
pleased
by
wohlstetter
s
eminence
bernard
brodie
had
always
resented
his
influence
and
was
forever
plotting
to
bring
him
down
still
wohlstetter
was
popular
compared
to
herman
kahn
all
the
nuclear
strategists
were
irritated
by
kahn
who
ultimately
left
rand
and
created
his
own
think
tank
the
hudson
institute
with
a
million
dollar
grant
from
the
rockefeller
foundation
so
that
is
that
i
probably
will
not
update
toooo
much
on
this
endeavor
because
like
i
said
it
is
nothing
particularly
earth
shattering
and
i
am
sure
you
are
all
sick
of
hearing
i
have
dumped
fat
on
his
well
fat
again
so
i
will
try
to
keep
the
weighty
subjects
to
a
minimum
and
write
about
more
important
things
like
chuck
bass
and
my
list
of
hgcs
and
with
any
luck
i
will
one
day
introduce
you
all
to
my
newest
interest
the
university
has
planned
to
begin
rotating
advanced
pharmacy
students
to
perform
clinical
rotations
in

retail

hospitals
and
health
clinics

early
as

we
live
in
a
country
where
payday
loan
shops
charge
their
victims
fifteen
percent
interest
for
a
two
week
loan
on
an
annual
basis
that
comes
out
to
390
percent
without
figuring
in
the
compounding
and
most
of
their
loans
do
get
compounded
week
after
week
as
the
working
poor
fall
deeper
into
the
pit
of
usury
these
heartless
can
work
right
out
in
the
open
because
they
paid
off
our
politicians
to
make
sure
there
s
no
law
to
stop
them
they
even
put
up
billboards
and
neon
signs
to
bring
in
more
suckers
does
it
really
matter
whether
such
companies
are
american
or
not
they
couldn

do
more
harm

they

sourcing
fabric
well
today
an
enterprising
friend
found
it
for
me
weirdly
it
s
not
for
sale
by
itself
but
is
included
as
an
extra
feature
with
one
of
stanley
s
full
length
feature
films
dust
devil
the
new
copies
are
a
bit
pricey
at
35
but
there
are
a
number
of
used
copies
available
for
a
fraction
of
the
cost
what
is
happening
to
me
the
past
few
years
have
certainly
seen
this
movement
towards
a
very
quiet
life
i
seem
to
be
incapable
of
handling
the
way
people
swarm
like
bees
the
hum
of
their
conversation
the
screeching
punctuation
of
those
who
seek
attention
above
the
din
i
crave
silence
like
a
i
am
angry
tonight
because
my
neighbors
are
once
again
out
on
their
postage
stamp
of
a
patio
laughing
it
up
like
cancer
has
left
the
planet
and
joblessness
was
soooo
yesterday
and
my
son
has
not
been
spending
his
first
four
hours
in
los
angeles
on
his
bike
waiting
for
someone
to
let
him
on
the
couch
that
sounds
so
jaded
i
am
angry
at
myself
for
being
jaded
but
i
have
weight
there
are
incredible
weights
held
released
thrown
purposed
unpurposed
i
used
to
drown
them
out
i
suppose
now
i
am
facing
them
head
to
head
and
distraction
is
just
another
semester
to
a
diploma
long
past
due
noise
was
a
deluge
to
thought
drown
those
rats
dave
looks
up
at
me
and
pushes
his
mad
curls
from
out
of
his
eyes
neither
mr
b
or
i
have
ever
done
this
kind
of
work
and
i
confess
i
can
be
pretty
impatient
and
rude
when
i
know
how
to
do
something
or
know
only
a
little
bit
about
how
to
do
something
but
do
not
want
anyone
to
know
i
do
not
know
 
cause
i
do
not
want
them
to
think
i
am
dumb
i
know
something
i
need
to
work
on
but
what
i
discovered
through
the
fence
building
project
was
that
it
was
a
lot
easier
to
have
fun
and
enjoy
the
hard
work
when
just
giving
in
to
that
ignorance
doing
my
best
with
the
knowledge
i
have
and
enjoying
the
give
and
take
of
working
together
with
mr
b
with
shared
leadership
in
a
project
the
results
will
make
you
feel
nauseous
or
fall
into
convulsions
subjects
highlighted
include
yards
away
the
water
boiled
as
the
old
bull
found
the
floating
body
of
the
first
scout
the
second
scout
snapped
his
head
in
the
direction
of
the
noise
just
in
time
to
see
his
fellow
scout
s
body
drug
under
the
water
in
the
gator
s
death
roll
the
scout
s
rifle
moved
to
his

almost
without
thought
pitcher
tensed
his
muscles
in
preparation
for
his
attack
have
a
lesser
grace
and
will
generously
provide
all
you
need
then
you
will
always
have
everything
you
need
and
plenty
left
over
to
share
with
others
don
t
get
caught
off
guard
make
sure
you
keep
your
eye
out
for
these
events
so
you
know
what
s
happening
at
the
magic
kingdom
on
the
day
of
your
visit
lord
i
have
much
to
learn
and
even
more
to
discover
about
your
plans
for
my
life
i
am
also
going
to
try
to
use
more
fresh
fruits
and
vegetables
to
soak
my
beans
instead
of
opening
a
can
to
plan
ahead
so
i
am
not
stuck
pulling
out
the
frozen
pizza
at
the
last
minute
to
cut
down
on
the
amount
of
chemicals
in
my
kitchen
i
suppose
i
should
start
in
the
most
obvious
place
by
kicking
once
again
my
diet
soda
habit
shhh
do
not
tell
emily
i
do
not
understand
the
choices
some
people
make
when
it
comes
to
the
animals
they
decide
to
bring
into
their
lives
they
do
not
feed
them
properly
they
do
not
spay
or
neuter
they
do
not
go
to
the
veterinarian
they
smile
and
tell
others
that
once
again
they
have
puppies
to
give
away
and
blame
it
on
the
un
neutered
dog
running
around
not
once
considering
that
they
are
half
of
the
problem
have
a
great
week

missy
groans
ugh
just
kiss
her
and
get
it
over
with
i
hunt
putting
myself
through
great
physical
and
mental
strain
for
jobs
that
i
usually
don
t
want
then
i
must
go
before
a
complete
stranger
grovel
and
humiliate
myself
and
beg
to
him
trying
to
justify
my
existence
to
convince
him
that
i
deserve
to
be
alive
to
have
food
clothing
shelter
health
care
and
leisure
if
the
stranger
hears
my
supplications
then
i
am
condemned
for
a
period
to
his
particular
form
of
punishment
in
which
he
may
grant
a
few
of
my
requests
and
provide
for
a
few
of
my
needs
being
skirmishers
makes
you
much
harder
to
hit
with
ranged
attacks
esspecially
if
you
keep
in
cover
forests
for
example
making
you
a
bit
more
survivable
you
are
also
much
more
maneuverable
thanks
to
being
able
to
march
and
shoot
giving
you
a
total
range
of
40
with
no
penalty
when
moving
and
shooting
finally
with
the
scout
rule
you
can
deploy
further
up
the
field
and
use
them
as
harassers
lone
character
assassins
and
war
machine
hunters
every
day
of
the
rest
of
my
life
it
is
all
well
and
good
when
mom
is
home
and
can
let
the
kiddos
sleep
in
but
it
will
not
be
ok
when
that
bus
rolls
up
at
exactly
7
43
a
m
a
couple
of
weeks
from
now
and
i
know
from
previous
experience
switching
up
bedtime
routines
and
sleep
schedules
does
not
happen
over
night
i
think
any
committed
mother
is
one
of
the
most
important
citizens
about
to
have
the
scare
of
his
life
so
i
m
not
as
bitter
about
my
dismissal
as
you
might
expect
even
though
no
one
from
the
company
told
me
i
d
been
canned
or
even
informed
me
that
my
next
column
and
a
scheduled
feature
were
no
longer
welcome
as
a
non
employed
contractor
in
our
brave
new
world
of
semi
employed
twenty
first
century
servitude
i
had
to
perceive
i
was
fired
we
all
know
how
these
arrangements
work
non
employees
float
in
an
opaque
legal
gelatin
that
can
wash
out
from
under
us
at
any
time
but
remember
i
had
it
coming
in
the
glove
compartment
and
the
same
was
true
for
all
of
us
everything
we
had
every
lived
was
a
twig
off
the
same
tree
a
finger
on
the
same
hand
add
time
an
it
became
blindingly
obvious
that
the
entire
tree
of
life
on
earth
was
alive
and
physically
connected
even
after
three
and
a
half
billion
years
not
in
any
metaphysical
way
but
literally
materially
back
through
all
tie
toward
the
root
the
same
primordial
mitochondrial
ocean
was
and
is
still
dividing
inside
each
and
every
one
of
us
boy
it
flew
by
i
am
really
happy
with
the
outcome
i
was
also
thinking
of
putting
a
small
basket
at
the
bottom
of
the
cupboard
to
put
clothes
in
that
are
too
small
and
make
a
rule
that
when
the
basket
is
full
it
must
be
put
into
the
clothes
tub
i
will
be
buying
another
tub
for
his
size
5
clothes
as
i
try
and
buy
clothes
a
season
ahead
my
vote
for
tribute
is
the
first
song
that
convinced
me
they
had
any
intent
of
becoming
serious
artists
instead
of
languishing
as
party
chasing
musical
pranksters
licensed
to

at
the
time

i
never
got
paul
s
boutique
though
i
can
understand
why
it
has
its
fans

me
check
your
head
seemed
like
a
stronger
leap
forward
particularly
the
first
single
pass
the
mic
though
our
local
corporate
alt
rock
station
prefers
endless
revisits
to
sabotage
and
so
whatcha

of
sorts

a

hours
to
put
everything
back
together
and
organized
at
the

time
i
could
barely
move
on
monday
after
i
did
all
that
work
but
it
was
fun
finding
all
kinds
of
stuff
i
forgot
about
ten
years
ago
we
were
ten
minutes
late
which
made
it
odd
that
no
other
cars
were
around
the
house

obviously
had
not

created

s

so
that
children
would
be
required
to
have
child
abuse
education
in
elementary

as
a
form
of
prevention
while
i
am
so
excited
for
erin
merryn
and
i
support
her
efforts
to
end
child
abuse
i
do
not
see
a
difference
between
this
new
law
and
the
ones
that
have
come
before
it
you
see
erin
merryn
will
admit
that
she
did
have
stranger
danger
in
her
illinois
school
system
and
i
had
good
touch
bad
touch
these
are
examples
of
child
abuse
education
in
any
case
straw
did
not
apologise
to
the
muslim
women
who
made
him
feel
uncomfortable
he
really
said
sorry
to
his
muslim
constituents
as
well
as
to
the
islamists
and
far
leftists
who
milked
this
infinitesimal
misdemeanour
they
demanded
that
straw
eat
a
lot
of
humble
pie
they
demanded

another
victim
of

i
was
outside
doing
yard
work
as
always
since
it
is
spring
i
just
got
my
patio
cleaned
off
from
winter
and
fall
leaves
and
branches
then
it
stormed
again
last
weelend
and
then
i
had
more
tree
branches
and
those
twirle
things
we
use
to
call
them
helicopters
what
i
recommend
is
that
you
do
it
to
your
blog
s
right
now
and
store
the
files
in
a
couple
of
places
offer
to
store
a
friend's
blog
perhaps
so
it
is
disaster
resistant
even
if
their
house
burns
down
or
is
hit
by
an
asteroid
they
shall
become
a
sign
and
a
wonder
on
you
and
your
descendants
forever
i
have
starting
putting
a
few
things
together
for
an
upcoming
color
themed
post
i
love
searching
for
photo
props
for
that
sort
of
thing
and
for
my
food
photography
too
i
just
found
this
round
cooling
rack
last
week
and
i
was
so
excited
i
have
been
looking
for
one
for
awhile
and
let
me
tell
you
are
they
hard
to
find
this
one
is
actually
new
i
put
up
a
photo
of
it
along
with
a
few
other
things
i
found
on
my
facebook
page
this
is
the
best
simple
home
cooking
when
tomatoes
are
much
nicer
and
tastier
in
the
summer
when
they
in
abundance
and
much
cheaper
if
you
like
the
sound
of
this
dish
give
it
a
try
simple
and
tasty
with
rice
or
nice
with
noodles
too
ukip
do
not
make
me
laugh
i
feel
motherhood
on
a
cellular
level
and
every
child
is
mine
the
thought
 
that
could
be
max
 
floats
through
my
brain
almost
daily
on
hearing
of
any
tragedy
befalling
a
child
we
saw
some
amazing

remarked

we

and
everything
in

personally
for
me
it
was
one
of
the
greatest
adventures
i
ve
had
it
was
challenging
and
there
was
a
lot
of
payoff
in
addition
to
keeping
the
bike
on
the
road
through
all
the
weather
we
had
to
pay
attention
to
how
it
was
behaving
and
make
sure
there
was
no
trouble
the
first
stop
was
meadville

north

just
south

so

you
cannot
invade

and
destroy

take
heart
nor
this
news
is
already
embarrassment
in
itself
your
bid
succeeded
because
most
people
detest
such
behaviour
by
political
parties
regardless
of
race
and
with
the
nepotism
and
limitless
term
issue
dap
is
as
bad
a
guy
as
perkasa
this
day
first
as
a
result
of
the
summer
earthquake
the
dedication
was
postponed
from
august
until
october
and
as
soon
as
the
monument
was
revealed
to
the
public
criticism
poured
in
for
me
the
first
problem
was
aesthetic
it
was
not
that
the
image
of
rev
king
emerging
from
the
rock
was
too
gray
stern
or
forbidding
as
some
critics
said
that
s
just
philistinism
rather
the
whole
thing
just
seemed
too
cautious
and
tame
first
it
just
isn
t
very
well
done
second
and
more
important
is
there
really
a
point
to
a
conventional
representational
portrait
sculpture
in
an
age
in
which
the
most
powerful
and
eventually
popular
monuments
the
vietnam
memorial
the
new
9
11
memorial
site
and
the
berlin
monument
to
the
murdered
jews
of
europe
draw
upon
a
more
modern
language
of
abstraction
the
king
monument
its
very
real
appeals
notwithstanding
could
fit
perfectly
well
in
a
neo
stalinist
sculpture
garden
or
political
cemetery
philosopher
cornel
west
went
even
further
though
in
a
very
different
direction
declaring
that
king
would
have
wanted
a
revolution
not
a
monument
that
is
only
ten
pounds
to
loose
i
guess
if
i
can
quit
smoking
for
8
months
i
can
drop
ten
pounds
in
a
month
or
two
right
ever
since
i
can
remember
i
have
been
obsessed
about
my
weight
i
know
i
am
in
a
much
better
space
than
a
lot
of
folks
who
are
50
or
100
pounds
overweight
i
should
not
complain
it
is
just
hard
for
me
to
look
down
at
where
my
stomach
used
to
be
and
to
see
where
it
is
now
i
know
one
thing
for
sure
jeans
with
a
34
waist
are
never
setting
foot
in
my
house
and
if
i
have
any
say
in
the
matter
i
plan
to
put
fluffy
outta
its
misery
once
and
for
all
so
when
i
am
being
arrogant
i
want
someone
to
listen
to
me
i
want
someone
to
understand
me
i
want
sympathy
i
want
someone
to
help
me
deal
with
an
underlying
issue
or
anxiety
or
fear
i
am
testing
to
identify
someone
who
can
assist
me
in
handling
my
distress
for
arrogance
aka
righteousness
is
fundamentally
an
indicator
signaling
distress
during
this
trial
i
have
concluded
that
the
prosecutors
made
their
case
i
will
vote
to
remove
president
clinton
from
office
not
only
because
he
is
guilty
of
both
articles
of
impeachment
but
also
because
i
believe
the
crimes
committed
here
demonstrate
that
he
is
capable
of
lying
routinely
whenever
it
is
convenient
he
is
not
trustworthy
simply
to
be
near
him
in
the
white
house
has
meant
not
only
tragic
heartache
for
his
wife
and
his
daughter
but
enormous
legal
bills
for
staff
members
and
friends
who
admired
him
and
yearned
for
his
success
but
who
have
been
caught
up
in
his
incessant
war
room

to
maintain
him

around

roses
before
i
get
started
in
hopes
that
i
might
have
gardening
success
i
would
not
want
a
novel
i
was
buying
telling
me
how
much
pathos
between
1
and
5
i
should
expect
for
it
or
how
the
book
had
the
 
whiff
 
of
a
nice
dan
brown
had
just
stabbed
him
i
thought
this
book
was
extremely
insightful
especially
the
section
explaining
why
they
feel
practices
like
breastfeeding
and
co
sleeping
mesh
so
well
with
the
catholic
views
of
natural
law
and
self
giving
love
after
reading
this
i
felt
like
i
understood
much
better
the
reasons
why
those
same
practices
felt
so
right
for
our
family
coming
back
home
and
switching
gears
to
preparations
for
brian's
hunt
he
wanted
me
to
go
also
but
the
boys
won
keeping
me
at
their
disposal
since
i
was
just
too
tired
to
go
camping
and
for
the
big
birthday
celebration
was
just
plain
fun
whenever
a

is
about

to

but
today
the

2005
is
very
different
the
number
of
changes
have
taken
place
in
upgrading
rules
and
regulations
formed
for
playing
the
cricket
new

australia
to
find
out
how
their

there
are
few
countries
in

that
are

from
these

are
accurate
and
give

about

it
was
kind
of
surreal
the
present
crisis
has
seen
a
lot
of
debate
about
mark
to
market
accounting
traders
tend
to
favor
mark
to
market
as
do
academics
who
mistrust
banks
 
motives
and
accounting
bankers
and
efficient
market
skeptics
argue
for
more
flexibility
the
usual
problem
of
course
is
that
in
a
crisis
prices
can
plummet
for
liquidity
reasons
which
can
cause
institutions
to
become
insolvent
on
a
mark
to
market
basis
causing
bankruptcies
liquidations
further
price
declines
and
more
insolvencies
very
few
people
are
comfortable
actually
allowing
this
dynamic
to
play
out
but
it
is
a
struggle
to
find
a
credible
alternative
accounting
regime
for
large
institutions
like
the
banks
that
hold
troubled
mortgages
there
is
an
even
more
fundamental
problem
with
mark
t0
market
accounting
it
is
circular

not
well
defined

halperin
s
insights
are
manifold
in
this
rich
section
of
the
book
here
i
list
those
that
were
most
salient
to
me
as
i
read
first
warner
points
to
and
halperin
fleshes
out
how
the
insistence
on
pride
can
actually
serve
to
deepen
the
shame
men
feel
about
their
desires
and
practices
by
re
relegating
them
to
the
closet
in
contra
distinction
to
an
out
and
proud
maleness
second
halperin
turns
to
a
right
wing
french
writer
marcel
jouhandeau
who
extolled
the
virtues
of
social
abjection
and
in
particular
humiliation
at
being
different
jouhandeau
and
later
genet
turn
abjection
on
its
head
into
a
kind
of
sacrilization
of
abjection
to
tease
this
out
thirdly
halperin
explicates
two
scenes
from
jean
genet
s
opus
in
which
genet
depicts
social
abjection
humiliation
as
a
process
and
where
the
abjected
humiliated
subject
responds
by
resignifying
the
abjection
as
either
a
source
of
pleasure
or
as
the
signifying
source
of
his
difference
in
halperin
s
interpretation
genet
s
narrators
find
freedom
precisely
by
identifying
with
their
abjection
and
embracing
it
refusing
its
deleterious
effects
and
instead
creating
for
themselves
a
re
signifying
and
life
affirming
defiance
the
more
they
are
humiliated
the
more
defiant
and
ecstatic
the
narrators
become
genet
s
narrative
insists
that
loving
someone
who
is
humiliated
socially
abject
requires
the
loving
of
their
abjection
itself
also
it
s
not
too
late
to
make
the
decision
to
join
us
did
you
even
know

jumping

while
there
are
other
things
that
are
dealt
with
in
the
early
paragraphs
of
the
judgment
the
nub
of
the
dispute
concerns
the
assessment
of
damages
and
so
it
is
to
this
issue
that
we
turn
me
they
are
horrible
this
is
horrible
this
is
worse
than
the

there
is
not
even
a

it
looks
white
in

but
trust
me
when
i
say
it
is
very
blue
i
am
a
actually
little
worried
that
it
will
be
too
blue
when
it
fully
cures
but
i
will
cross
that
bridge
when
i
get
to
it
then
he

go

have
put
in

too
much
work
to

that
happen
speaking
of
heart
of
wisdom
the
website
and
ebooks
have
been
a
great
source
of
inspiration
and
ah
ha
moments
for
me
recently
the
bible
first
approach
at
the
core
of
it
articulates
so
well
what
i
was
trying
to
figure
out
this
year
i
knew
what
i
did
not
want
and
had
a
fair
idea
of
what
i
did
want
but
the
heart
of
wisdom
teaching
approach
helped
me
fill
in
a
few
gaps
in
my
understanding
and
simplify
my
very
complicated
picture
of
our
ideal
homeschool
the
free
guide
to
choosing
and
using
resources
renewed
my
confidence
in
my
choices
of
what
to
read
and
not
read
with
the
children
i
am
adopting
the
how
concept
but
am
not
following
robin's
4
year
plan
or
using
the
unit
studies
what
we
are
doing
i
will
write
about
more
next
year
as
it
is
a
work
in
progress
in
the
eyes
of
the
kids
it
will
flow
on
well
and
look
similar
to
this
year
but
in
my
head
and
on
paper
it
is
somewhat
tidier
this
was
a
minor
crisis
a
mere
adventure
in
the
grand
scheme
of
things
even
the
children
were
unphased
by
the
news
that
mummy
would
be

a

expected
i

the
next

been
reminded
that
so
much
in
our
lives
is
beyond
our
control
and
is
instead
in
the
hands
of
the
randomness
of
chance

will
definitely
be
making
the
pencil

later
in
the
year
and
starting
the
cardigan
fairly
soon
planning
my
projects
made
sure
that
i
used
some
fabric
and
patterns
from
my
stash
which
i
was
pleased
about
and
already
i
can
see
that
some
items
are
getting
more
wear
than
others
my

excellent

one
of

to
really
focus
on
this
area
details
several
controversial
subjects
in
a
non
exploitative
manner
you
got
a
real
sense
of
the
time
period
and
people
elvis
came
from
and
a
real
sense
of
gladys
as
a
person
mightymo
the
girls
and
i
watched
the
movie
courageous
this
weekend
the
movie
was
excellent
and
very
emotional
since
i
am
the
queen
of
cry
i
cried
a
lot
cinematically
there
were
a
few
scenes
that
were
not
as
professional
as
most
modern
day
feature
films
mainly
i
thought
a
few
of
the
actors
were
kind
of
stiff
nothing
major
though
it
was
not
like
going
to
an
elementary
school
play
or
anything
of
course
i
eventually
learnt
that
this
was
not
how
publishing
really
works
or
even
writing
i
scribbled
away
as
a
young
person
mainly
pony
stories
in
brown
covered
woolworth
s
exercise
books
narrow
feint
lines
close
together
in
case
you
didn
t
know
then
i
grew
up
realised
that
writing
was
not
what
i
could
do
as
a
living
and
embarked
on
a
varied
if
not
variegated
career
encompassing
modelling
acting
dj
ing
being
a
cabin
crew
member
with
ba
and
after
marriage
a
personnel
consultant
brook
street
bureau
and
lowly
minion
at
the
observer
in
the
letter
gadahn
offers
suggestions
on
how
to
communicate
with
western
media
including
the
idea
of
offering
a
handful
of
journalists
a
chance
to
interview
high
ranking
al
qaida
members
including
bin
laden
for
the
attack
anniversary
gadahn
also
chastises
western
media
for
not
challenging
u
s
officials
and
condemning
the
jihadist
movement
so
here
i
am
on
friday
evening
after
a
tough
busy
tiring
week
and
all
i
wanted
to
do
was
drive
to
the
lot
and
water
my
tomatoes
and
pick
some
veg
for
tea
so
i
kicked
off
my
work
shoes
into
the
shed
slipped
my
wellies
on
and
wandered
around
my
plot
seeing
what
was
ready
for
picking
plenty
of
courgettes
gorgeous
french
beans
spinach
some
raspberries
eaten
as
i
picked
them
a
bunch
of
sweet
peas
to
bob
in
a
jam
jar
on
my
kitchen
windowsill
sadly
it
was
at
the
o2
great
idea
for
a
venue
but
sadly
lacking
in
atmosphere
you
wander
from
a
nice
indoor
street
to
a
concrete
waiting
pen
by
the
time
we
got
in
we
did
feel
that
instead
of
being
wristbanded
they
could
have
cut
the
middle
out
and
just
tagged
us
though
the
ear
also
the
music
venue
is
sponsered
by
stella
4
so
no
concert
beer
for
me
not
a
problem
but
the
cidre
which
was
also
being
served
was
unbelieveably
chemically
smelling
that
you
knew
if
the
person
next
to
you
had
been
drinking
it
the
show
was
not
animated
in
high
definition
despite
airing
in
2009
this
becomes
incredibly
apparent
when
you
view
the
screencaps
of
this
upscale
q
tec
s
new
technology
f
o
c
u
s
did
what
it
could
but
they
went
from
the
dvd
masters
which
didn
t
have
the
best
quality
it
s
not
the
worst
upscale
i
ve
seen
but
it
s
certainly
not
one
you
ll
want
to
show
screencaptures
of
i
ve
included
16
screencaptures
from
the
first
few
episodes
and
the
op
ed
for
reference
it
does
look
much
better
in
motion
though
mum
used
to
put
the
rugs
over
the
washing
line
in
the
back
garden
and
beat
them
with
a
carpet
beater
i
can
still
smell
the
dust
that
used
to
billow
out
of
them
i
always
wanted
to
help
so
when
she
finished
she
put
the
small
rug
from
the
kitchen
onto
the
line
and
left
me
with
the
carpet
beater
one
of
these
would
make
a
great
mother's
day
gift
for
yourself
or
someone
else
if
you
do
not
want
to
make
your
own
you
can
also
purchase
a
pair
in
my
shop
putting
my
finger
on
any
other
bands
that
these
guys
might
be
similar
to
was
pretty
difficult
based
on
the
down
tuned
riffing
and
chest
imploding
production
job
my
initial
thought
was
that
they
sound
like
a
more
punk
version
of
france's
celeste
that
is
definitely
a
compliment
because
it
is
no
easy
feat
to
be
as
heavy
as
a
band
like
celeste
nor
is
it
an
easy
feat
to
write
punk
songs
that
are
not
regurgitated

days
hey

suddenly
my
four

whips
out
this
little
beauty
in
recent
events
the
american
retailers
have
been
tredding
softly
due
to
the
downturn
in
the
economy
they
have
become
less
risky
more
cautious
and
saving
for
better

ahead
we
as

have
realized
that
this
is
the
right

to

he
told

i
do
on

of
that
we
had
to
rush
the

to
the

on
monday
noticed
her
licking
her
on
closer
examination
there
an
extra
hole
back
there
after
an
afternoon
at
the
vets
she
had
to
be
sedated
in

for
them
to
examine
it
we
took
her
home
drowsie
on
morphine
what
a
sad
looking
girl
she
was
we
got
her
home
and
she
wobbled
her
way
downstairs
rather
quickly
to
her
crate
and
crashed
well
what
a
treat
trying
to
put
the
cone
on
her
she
wanted
nothing
to
do
with
that
i'd
put
it
on
she'd
claw
it
off
this
went
on
several
times
i
finally
decided
it
was
too
big
and
cut
it
down
well
i
cut
too
much
off
so
back
to
the
vets
this
morning
to
buy
another
this
time
i
measured
to
make
sure
she
is
having
a
hard
time
navigating
the
house
the
cone
ketches
on

stopping
her

she

for
and

abusing

the
judge
in

case
maintained
that
the
race
of
the
victims
and
their
abusers
was
coincidental
a
computerized
system
for
distributing
spending
vehicles
comprising
what
if
building
the
right
church
depends
on
using
all
the
wrong
people
this
is
a
question
that
is
found
on
the
back
cover
the
new
book
a
radical
idea
by
pastor
and
bestselling
author
david
platt
but
first
a
few
words
about
pastor
platt
he
is
an
incredibly
gifted
expositor
preacher
of
the
word
i
have
heard
him
preach
by
visiting
his
church
website
and
watching
the
videos
of
his
messages
right
now
i
am
listening
to
his
series
on
matthew
and
it
is
powerfully
convincing
of
just
who
the
person
of
jesus
christ
and
it
is
also
very
convicting
in
that
the
holy
spirit
uses
the
messages
to
speak
to
my
heart
and
to
my
relationship
with
jesus
christ
and
when
it
comes
to
radical
he
is
to
be
numbered
among
the
few
and
far
between
in
our
world
who
can
be
defined
by
the
word
radical
because
that
he
is
but
in
a
very
good
and
godly
way
it
s
like
the
saying
you
just
have
to
be
there
to
understand
well
you
just
have
to
read
his
books
radical
and
the
radical
experiment
as
well
as
listen
to
him
preach
to
fully
understand
what
i
mean
by
my
referring
to
him
as
radical
and
we
as
believers
should
all
be
so
radical
in
our
faith

if
you
have
never
been
before
this

the

out
this

you
won

need
reminding
is
it
justified

the

snubbed
pakistan
players
for
the

relations

another
leave

alone
as
it

the
power

has
a

a
boss
who
suspected
a

decided
to
make
an

why

it
was
the
first
project
i
made
from
the
book
but
i
can
see
it
is
going
to
be
a
favourite
for
baby
gifts
a
lot
of
the
projects
are
on
the
 
weird
cute
 
side
and
i
was
slightly
worried
that
the
result
might
be

i
think
he
is
turned

which
is
in

something
for
us
to
ponder
it
s
been
running
through
my
mind
lately
and
i
thought
i
d
share
it
there
is
always
a
story
so
here's
the
story
behind
the
name
my
mom
was
a
part
of
a
mothers
of
multiples
group
in
texas
the
name
of
the
group
was
2
is
beautiful
we
actually
went
to
kindergarten
with
another
set
of
twins
and
1
set
of
triplets
how
cool
is
that
i
guess
it
was
something
in
that
big
texas
water
tower
lol
after
we
left
texas
the
group
slowly
disbanned
as
we
all
grew
up
and
apart
i
do
not
think
we
have
any
of
the
original
t
shirts
left
that
my
mom
had
printed
but
pretty
soon
i
will
offer
them
in
my
etsy
shop
to
buy
what
i
like
instead
of
what
i
think
i
should
buy
for
a
certain
spot
let
me
thank
you
in
advance
and
please
know
i
am
going
to
read
each
and
every
one
of
your
comments
and
i
hope
there
is
at
least
one
and
i
will
try
the
ones
that
might
work

my

the
short
story
has
been
in
major
decline
in
britain
to
the
point
where
it
is
almost
dead
and
i
began
this
blog
lamenting
this
fact
it
is
years
since
the
fact
that
short
stories
do
not
sell
became
established
publishing
wisdom
and
many
british
writers
including
me
originally
a
short
story
writer
were
forced
away
from
short
story
writing
into
other
forms
it
is
years
since
squeezed
by
market
forces
the
british
print
literary
magazines
the
last
great
haven
of
the
short
story
more
or
less
disappeared
online
magazines
having
yet
to
achieve
the
same
kind
of
reputation
with
the
literary
establishment
as
i
have
written
before
i
have
had
my
own
attempt
to
combat
this
last
decline
but
found
the
battle
so
hard
it
left
me
no

well

but
i
m
glad
to
be
out
from
under
the
skyscrapers
and
back
under
the
stars
i
m
pretty
certain
now
that
i
could
never

city
girl
sunday
the
venue
that
i
have
been
eyeing
for
our
reception
was
having
an
open
house
so
i
decided
to
wait
to
do
any
tours
until
then
since
it
will
be
set
up
all
fancy
and
what
not
for
the
open
house
well
unfortunately
alex
could
not
come
with
us
because
he
was
working
a
24
hour
shift
so
i
went
with
my
parents
the
venue
was
very
nice
and
extremely
accommodating
this
was
the
first
time
my
mom
has
a
realization
that
her
little
girl
is
getting
married
she
said
she
had
chills
the
whole
time
hahaha
whole
wheat
dear
baby
girl
while
i
enjoy
watching
you
grow
day
by
day
please
slow
down
if
only
for
a
little
while
i
love
those
baby
giggles
and
those
baby
smiles
i'd
like
to
hold
on
to
them
if
even
just
for
a
little
bit
longer
you
and
your
brother
bring
me
such
joy
i
am
so
glad
you
picked
me
for
your
mama
here
s
another
crock
of
fresh
delivered
by
the
right
wing
of
the
republican
party
which
has
become
so
far
as
i
can
see
the
only
wing
of
the
republican
party
the
richer
rich
people
get
the
more
jobs
they
create
really
i
have
a
total
payroll
of
about
60
people
most
of
them
working
for
the
two
radio
stations
i
own
in
bangor
maine
if
i
hit
the
movie
jackpot
as
i
have
from
time
to
time
and

a
piece
of
a
film
that
grosses

going
to

t
think
so
since
i

this

my

greeting
from
my
oh
so
wonderful
husband
another
project
we
re
excited
to
tell
you
about
has
been
brewing
cross
continent
since
the
american
society
of
anaesthesiologists
conference
in
chicago
last
year
when
the
department
of
anesthesiology
at
the
university
of
florida
presented
a
giant
cheque
for
33
700
for
lifebox
we
took
a
gameshow
style
photo
and
then
got
down
to
business
unfortunately
trying
to
teach
yourself
how
to
do
a
back
handspring
at
the
age
of
10
is
quite
difficult
when
you
do
not
have
someone
there
to
properly
spot
you
and
teach
you
the
progressions
so
i
never
was
able
to
perform
one
the
first
step
is
to
order
yourself
a
good
serving
of
this
in
itself
is
hard
the
menu
is
the
size
of
a
tome
and
makes
your
eyes
glaze
before
the
first
drop
even
hits
your
lips
the
honey
infused
variety
is
a
favourite
as
well
as
the
chosen
one
and
goldwasser
slip
it
down
quickly
and
get
yourself
a
cocktail
a
simple
moscow
mule
will
tide
you
through
to
the
main
courses
without
worry
yes
kellie
had
carli
shown
below
nicole
had
twin
girls
and
a
ton
of
my
friends
are
pregnant
two
with
twins
and
erin
gave
birth
to
tommy
on
the
stairs
in
her
house
which
i
am
mentioning
because
if
you
have
not
read
about
it
before
you
really
should
now
it
is
hilarious
and
amazing
and
i
can
not
believe
i
live
3000
miles
away
from
this
baby
is
not
she
adorable
miss
you

i
can
not

but
a

said
the
latest
move
was
tantamount
to
encouraging
the

to
have
a
real
go
at

mark

would
you
like

i
said

knowing
that
this
was
an
impossible
task
for
a
guy
who
is
not
in
the
music
industry
and
a
difficult
one
even
for
those
who
are
connected
he
called
me
a
month
later
to
tell
me
that
he
was
working
on
it
and
had
a
plan
he
had
gotten
in
touch
with
paul

pilot
whom
he
knew
from

and
was
trying
to

a

day
at

and
needed
to
unwind
with
a
kiddie
cocktail
he
was
horrified
by
the
way
when
he
discovered
this
drink
was
made
with
7
up
soda
he
sputtered
wiping
his
tongue
do
you

to

he
totally
judged
us
for
ordering
it
jack
abandoned
his
after
scrubbing
the
inside
of
his
mouth
with
a
napkin
because
it
was
spicy
once
they
arrived
to
the
condo
community
in
which
we
live
i
gave
them
a
quick
tour
of
the
rental
condo
i
was
having
them
stay
in
for
the
weekend
and
we
got
on
our
way
to
notre
dame
stadium
for
the
game
we
arrived
to
campus
to
see
nothing
less
then
a
long
line
of
cars
attempting
to
get
piled
into
the
fast
filling
parking
lots
on
campus
we
were
able
to
find
two
parking
spots
close
to
each
other
in
one
of
the
north
lots
so
that
we
could
stay
close
to
each
other
to
help
with
directions
after
some
walking
and
quick
site
seeing
of
the
campus
we
headed
into
the
stadium
to
get
our
seats
with
a
normal
football
game
you
are
assigned
a
specific
seating
location
with
your
ticket
but
with
the
blue
gold
spring
game
all
tickets
are
general
seating
admission
excluding
the
vip
tags
which
are
seated
in
the
club
seats
closest
to
the
field
on
the
50
yard
line
once
we
got
seated
and
did
the
national
anthem
we
got
food
orders
from
everyone
before
the
game
started
laochra
frisuer
and
myself
all
headed
down
to
the
concessions
which
were
only
available
on
the
main
level
of
the
stadium
to
get
burgers
and
such
for
everyone
while
in
line
at
the
concessions
i
noticed
laochra
wiped
her
hair
only
to
smear
what
appeared
to
be
a
fly
by
bombing
from
an
overhead
bird
yes
a
bird
took
a
on
laochra
s
head
most
birds
look
for
a
shiny
clean
car
but
in
this
case
the
bird
wanted
to
make
a
hit
and
run
bombing
on
an
unsuspecting
person
below
as
everyone
can
imagine
i
immediately
started
laughing
hysterically
which
only
further
enraged
laochra
about
the
situation
now
at
this
point
frisuer
took
notice
to
me
laughing
and
laochra
stomping
away
in
search
of
a
bathroom
frisuer
then
asked
what
is
so
funny
i
then
replied
a
bird
just
took
a
on
laochra
s
head
now
that
frisuer
had
been
fully
filled
in
on
why
i
was
gasping
for
air
from
laughter
she
also
began
to
laugh
hysterically
about
the
fly
by
crapping
when
laochra
returned
from
the
bathroom
frisuer
and
myself
tried
our
hardest
not
to
laugh
but
it
was
just
way
too
funny
we
did
eventually
order
our
food
and
head
back
to
our
seats
while
watching
overhead
in
case
the
birds
wanted
to
make
a
second
bombing
run
on
laochra
my
little
first
graders
are
so
sweet

my
friend

little
boy
to

exact
and
guess

amazing

they
asked
me
if

could
throw
her
a
baby
shower
how
adorably
sweet
is
that
of
course
i
said
yes
how
could
i
not
i
am
punishing
myself
for
falling
off
the
wagon
by
signing
up

pinky
swear
that

two
days

about
cq
crazy
quilting
is
that
it
is
no
holds
bared
anger
i
do
not
understand
it
i
am
glad
it
is
beyond
my
comprehension
because
it
means
that
someone
is
so
deeply
entrenched
in
their
sins
that
they
have
chosen
evil
so
many
times
that
they
have
grown
to
love
it
i
cannot
say
they
are
happy
in
their
ways
that
is
contrary
to
eternal
truth
but
they
are
addicted
to
the
satisfaction
of
it
the
thrill
the
adrenaline
rush
perhaps
they
choose
to
remain
lost
and
rebellious
ps

the
independent
complaints
directorate
has
opened
an
investigation
into
the
violence
driven
police
raid
against
the
hapless
patrons
of
the
24
hour
catz
pyjamas
bistro
in
melville
in
late
february
various
cops
were
suspended
pending
the
investigation
after
 
shocked
senior
police
officers
 
had
viewed
a
video
recording
of
the
attack
all
victims
and
witnesses
were
asked
to
contact
investigating
officer
chris
de
jager
on
011220

in
the
nineteenth
century
the
area
was
a
hive
of
activity
and
other
long
lost
pubs
such
as
the
british
oak
the
hulme
street
tavern
the
premier
arms
the
standard
arms
the
middleton
arms
and
the
union
arms
all
stood
within
about
100
yards
of
the
spread
eagle
that
a
teetotal
working
men
s
club
in
the
area
lasted
only
a
few
years
during
the
1860s
should
come
as
no
surprise
now
to
the
physics
newton
s
third
law
tells
us
that
every
force
comes
with
a
reaction
force
which
has
the
same
size
as
the
original
force
but
acts
in
the
opposite
direction
when
you
re
sitting
on
a
chair
for
example
you
are
pushing
the
chair
downwards
and
in
turn
the
chair
is
pushing
you
back
up
allowing
you
to
hopefully
sit
comfortably
without
falling
down
if
you
drop
a
stone
into
water
similarly
the
stone
pushes
down
on
the
water
and
the
water
pushes
the
stone
back
up
or
in
other
words
gives
a
lift
to
the
stone
however
there
is
another
force
gravity
that
s
trying
to
pull
the
stone
right
down
if
the
lift
trying
to
push
the
stone
up
is
not
as
strong
as
the
force
of
gravity
pulling
the
stone
down
the
stone
you
guessed
it
falls
down
save
the
date
for
the
holly
jolly

an
exquisite

not
only
decadent
they
are
also

a
delightfully
silky

indulgence
things
got
heavy
in
the
middle
of
the
hill
taking
down
the
destroyer
with
my
man
o
war
unit
and
my
own
jack
the
marksman
doing
nothing
but
some
pop
shots
at
sorscha
after
that
with
her
jug
on
range
of
the
fight
i
simply
sent
my
destroyer
to
her
which
he
did
in
one
swift
aided
by
the
butcher
s
spell
but
still
not
popping
the
feat
she
s
squishy
like
that
i
know
it
isn
t
far
away
but
people
are
stubborn
with
all
rights
to
be
a
galaxy
of
left
hand
scrawl
and
crossed
out
words
everything
was
exquisite
the
flavours
were
delicate
and
enticing
with
the
spices
dancing
over
your
taste
buds
and
never
being
overpowering
exactly
like
good
indian
food
should
be
i
had
never
been
there
before
but
it
was
obvious
that
benares
was
a
rather
superior
indian
restaurant
given
the
events
of
late
2001
it
wouldn
t
matter
mid
august
she
d
said
goodbye
to
her

the
last

they

just
days
later
she

on
the

driving
back
from
the

the
second
the

on
tv
when
she
got
back
to
her
mother
s
and
they
turned
on
the
news
i
did
blog
about
that
or
maybe
i
wrote
it
in
my
book
i
can
not
remember
anyway
i
wrote
somewhere
about
how
clay
super
glued
brooklyn's
hands
together
before
she
was
even
1
year
old
that
was
awful

i
love
the
idea
of
hanging

over
a

to
give
baby
something
colorful
and
fun
to
look
past
the

how
cute
would
it
be
to
make
and
hang
a
few
of
these
for
a
little
girl's
spring
birthday
party
if
i
truly
say
that
i
trust
with
each
and
every
step
i
take
then
i
need
to
actually
do
that
the
days
ahead
will
be
no
different
than
the
ones
i
have
already
taken
he
has
every

covered
he
has
already
planned
out
this

it
is
up
to
me
to
trust
him
if
i
really
do

where
is

talk

what
do
i
have

fear
from
cancer
absolutely
nothing

it
returns
then
we

as

began
to
recognize
the
amount
of
dots
on
the
die
and
was
able
to
just
tell
us
the
number
without
counting
of

since
i
had
to
come
up
with
something
that
most
fifth
graders
felt
very
confident
about
and
was
still
very
fun
i
chose

this
was

much

i
will
tell
you
i
have
long
been
keen
on
red
wines
from
new
zealand
and
have
often
wondered
why
so
many
consumers
are
hesitant
to
try
them
and
persist
in
regarding
new
zealand
as
solely
a
white
wine
producing
country
and
look
to
australia
for
their
reds
i
do
my
best
to
win
them
round
but
even
at
the
annual
new
zealand
tasting
i
spoke
to
two
men
who
did
not
even
want
to
try
a
kiwi
red
despite
my
best
efforts
the
ability
of
fish
larvae
to
survive
has
a
huge
effect
on
the
population
down

road
says
biologist
lee
fuiman
director
of
the
university
of

marine
science
institute
in
port
aransas
who
was
not
involved
with
the
study
a
small
change
in
the
percent
survival
equals
a
large
change
in
the
adult
population
i
ve
made
a
point
to
work
on
my
emotional
connections
to
food
and
my
size
like
i
ve
said
in
the
past
i
don
t
really
recognize
what
weight
i
have
lost
unless
i
look
at
the
size
of
my
pants
or
the
scale
i
know
that
may
sound
a
bit
crazy
but
it
s
true
i
didn
t
have
a
bad
self
image
before
letting
go
of
my
weight
but
i
also
didn
t
see
who
i
really
physically
was
i
look
and
look
and
can
see
that
i
feel
better
and
i
get
a
lot
of
compliments
of
how
much
i
ve
lost
but
for
me
i
ve
lost
and
gained
much
more
than
weight
after
dropping
my
son
and
two
friends
off
at
school
this
sunny
wednesday
in
northern
california
i
came
home
to
find

i
hope
yundi

will
forgive

for
posting
this
since
i
am
enthusiastically
promoting

by
doing

jasmine
what
is
happened
delphina
gaped
up
at
me
expecting
me
to
have
all
the
answers
as
she
always
did
there
was
a
vivid
red
line
on
her
cheek
where
the
petal
had
sliced
her
skin
we
completed
the
evening
with
a
walk
around
town
and
dinner
at
oscars
oscars
was
our
favourite
eatery
during
our
time
in
york
and
again
most
of
my
friends
and
family
have
eaten
with
me
there
at
one
point
unfortunately
the
lovely
building
and
courtyard
they
used
to
occupy
was
only
rented
and
they
were
unable
to
renew
their
lease
however
they
moved
to
a
building
only
just
around
the
corner
and
the
food
was
as
fantastic
as
ever
the
best
headphones
with
noise
canceling
feature
i
stood
up
to
say
good
bye
like
all
the
rest
rome
was
not
built
in
a
day
and
neither
is
a
new
set
of
china
so
patience
my
patience
how
i
hate
being
patient
it
must
be
the
total
opposite
to
impetuous
is
called
for
over
time
this
porcelain
will
hopefully
become
my
new
collectible
and
will
take
pride
of
place
in
our
armoire
did
i
mention
that
i
have
a
weakness
for
white
china
xv
i
wrote
a
post
quite
a
while
ago
describing
my
1st
saudi
wedding
i
ever
attended
here
of
course
no
two
weddings
are
ever
the
same
each
one
has
its
own
uniqueness
that
the
bride
wishes
to
include
in
her
special
day
i
love
the
pungent
and
sharp
flavor
of
fermented
black
bean
sauce
because
of
its
aggressive
and
viscous
properties
it
tastes
amazing
doused
over
another
component
with
a
neutral
flavor
and
texture
like
steamed
tofu
if
you
do
not
have
a
steamer
you
can
fill
a
large
saucepan
with
a
few
inches
of
water
and
place
a
slightly
curved
bowl
of
tofu
right
into
it
simply
cover
and
steam
to
create
the
perfect
vehicle
for
a
rich
and
spicy
black
bean
sauce
this
dish
is
healthy
delicious
and
incredibly
easy
to
make
lighting
is
an
element
of
design
that
is
often
overlooked
and
under
purchased
that
light
that
hooks
to
your
ceiling
in
the
middle
of
your
room
is
not
your
only
light
source
and
the
thing
is
that
it
was
not
a
big
deal
and
it
did
not
affect
anything
and
i
am
the
only
one
who
cared
i
did
not
realize
just
how
much
i
was
blowing
it
out
of
proportion
until
i
spoke
with
hunter
on
the
phone
i
am
pretty
sure
he
thought
i
must
have
done
something
really
horrible
that
was
going
to
cost
the
company
money
or
something
by
the
way
i
was
talking
about
it
by
the
time
he
understood
what
a
small
issue
it
was
i
felt
a
bit
ridiculous
for
having
been
almost
in
tears
but
that
is
how
i
work
i
care
very
much
about
what
i
do
and
i
take
pride
in
it
i
am
a
strict
task
master
with
myself
and
just
push
and
push
and
push
myself
towards
better
and
better
results
help
me
if
i
make
a
simple
mistake
because
i
just
go
off
the
rails
a
bit
sometimes
i
take
a
breath
think
things
through
and
think
jesus
christ
kid
calm
the
down
or
do
not
enjoy
that
heart
attack
you
are
working

mildly
telling
that

more

on

in
summary
the
effects
of
fdi
whether
positive
or
negative
depend
on
the
ability
of
the
government
to
enhance
the
so
called
crowding
in
effect
defined
as
the
development
and
upgrading
of
private
firms
which
can
thus
benefit
from
linkages
with
foreign
companies
while
reducing
the
crowding
out
effect
which
instead
is
the
distortion
of
growth
of
the
domestic
private
sector
due
to
unregulated
competition
and
lack
of
technological
transfer
governments
need
to
ensure
that
their
domestic
firms
can
grasp
the
potential
benefits
deriving
from
the
spillovers
of
fdi
as
well
as
creating
an
environment
leading
to
regulated
and
healthy
investments
while
the
effects
of
fdi
depend
on

to
cry
for
him
the
fact
that
his

make
fun
of
him
for
smelling
or
for
being
a
baby
when
i
took
him
into
the
preschool
he
is
in
i
walked
in
and
said
hi
i
am
looking
for
a
place
for
my
almost
4
year
old
son
she
said
no
problem
we
have
room
and
i
literally
cried
and
said
one
thing
though
he
is
not
trained
and
she
said
no
problem
and
i
cried
harder
the
jews
were
denying
all
of
this
to
them
the
preaching
of
the
cross
was
foolishness
unto
them
they
were
rejecting
paul
and
his
apostleship
thus
they
were
rejecting
jesus
christ
for
he
was
whom
paul
preached
this

every

must

this
is
the
first
quilt
that
i
finished
heather
bailey
really
started
my
love
for
fabrics
and
quilting
with
her
freshcut
collection
it
really
was
a
big
quilt
to
make
for
my
first
project
but
it
is
one
of
those
quilts
that
still
gets
used
every
fall
it
seems
to
get
softer
and
more
comfortable
with
age
i
remember
trying
to
read
online
as
much
as
i
could
about
quilting
and
how
to
make
a
quilt
i
found
a
video
on
youtube
that
showed
you
how
to
baste
a
quilt
i
ended
up
basting
this
one
with
thread
and
rolling
it
up
on
a
long
board
to
keep
everything
straight
it
is
a
bit
different
than
how
i
do
things
today
but
the
quilt
did
turn
out
really
nice
and
it
was
really
easy
to
quilt
it
that
way
the
whole
situation
kept
me
away
from
my
blogs
for
very
long
too
long
maybe
and
then
one
day
i
started
to
pray
not
that
i
did
not
pray
before
but
this
time
it
was
different
i
started
to
have
long
conversation
with
my
and
ask
him
to
give
me
more
strength
and
faith
and
courage
and
suddenly
my
life
started
to
get
better
not
that
the
situation
in
haiti
is
better
but
my
personal
life
gets
richier
and
i
have
learned
to
cop
with
the
environment
not
as
i
would
want
it
but
as
it
is
when
there
is
no
other
choice
the

tuesday
evening
found
me
lakeside
with
three
dear
friends
savoring
a
picnic
in
the
park
the
water
glistened
in
the
sun
children
played
together
dogs
barked
a
baby
cried
and
all
was
right
with
the
world
now
consider
the
real
value
of
so
many
of
the
popular
images
we
see
all
over
the
internet
i
really
do
not
understand
why
these
 
fad
 
pictures
attract
so
much
attention
what
do
i
mean
for
now
i
will
share
this
recipe
with
you
luckily
there
was
a
photo
of
it
on
my
hard
drive
the
hard
thing
is
i
can
not
say
anything
quite
yet
something
very
unexpected
happened
to
us
on
friday
i
can
say
is
good
my
husband
is
amazing
faithful
and
godly
my
boys
are
happy
and
healthy
well
except
for
this
cold
we
have
and
baby
o
and
mama
are
just
fine
i
finally
got
a
chance
to
sit
down
and
do
some
work
in
my
journal
for
fun
this
last
weekend
i
forget
how
much
i
love
it
i
think
i
need
to
do
another
30
day
challenge
maybe
in
december
to
get
back
into
the

because
that
is
my
favorite
thing
to
do
and
now
the
boys
have
it
too
my
2
y
o
is
miserably
uncomfortable
and
has
to
appetite
with
a
slight
fever
argh
hey
aaron
remember
when
you
had
long
hair
and
a
scuzzy
beard
and
played
a
manly
as
biker
in
erin
brockovich
because
i
certainly
do
it
was
a
real
departure
from
your
breakout
role
in
in
the
company
of
men
as
a
slick
sociopathic
abuser
of
women
and
oh
em
gee
me
likey
you
are
so
completely
masculine
yet
so
completely
approachable
a
hunk
who
likes
chopping
wood
to
make
into
an
extension
on
our
log
cabin
but
then
comes
in
to
watch
30
rock
with
me
under
a
slanket
on
the
sofa
what
do
you
mean
you
want
the
bit
with
the
arms
oh
ok
i
suppose
you
did
make
me
that
macaroni
cheese
i
asked
for
you
deserve
it
what
s
that
you
want
to
let
me
wear
your
plaid
shirt
sure
anything
for
you
aaron
why
don
t
you
get
into
one
of
the
suits
you
wore
in
thank
you
for
smoking
and
i
ll
make
myself
comfortable
in
the
bedroom
in
and
out
of
these
blue
lines
like
i
m
sexin
the
page
for
learning
to
be
its
own
reward
without
use
of
a
merit
system
i
really
thought
i
d
have
a
lot
to
write
about
here
concerning
structure
but
i
don
t
obviously
the
internal
structure
is
different
the
two
protagonists
meet
but
are
already
in
love
by
the
beginning
the
impediment
really
isn
t
an
impediment
of
the
usual
sort
a
rival
it
s
a
style
that
s
the
impediment
and
that
s
easily
overcome
and
then
we
do
end
happily
ever
after
nuclear
materials
for
malicious
i
think
back
to
this
time
last
year
a
time
when
i
had
another
countdown
ticking
away
in
my
head
how
significant
the
month
of
april
has
become
in
my
life
last
year
i
eagerly
awaited
the
meeting
of
my
birth
daughter
it
was
an
event
that
i
had
dreamt
of
and
imagined
for
17
years
leading
up
to
that
marvelous
day
i
remember
how
nervous
i
was
yet
how
blissfully
happy
and
excited
and
then
finally
came
the
moment
that
i
got
to
see
her
to
hug
her
and
release
the
tears
of
absolute
euphoria
that
had
been
building
up
for
so
long
what
a
precious
incredible
moment
that
was
one
that
i
will
never
ever
forget
i
love
that
my
dear
sweet
husband
was
right
there
with
me
just
as
enchanted
as
i
was
as
if
she
were
his
own
birth
daughter
into
a
new
period
what
do
you
want
to
think
about
the
neighbours
won
t
object
but
this
is
not
what
needs
to
be
going
on
in
my
head
at
this
moment
this
guy
doesn
t
need
an
essay
he
needs
a
response
do
i
give
it
to
him
and
go
home
do
i
keep
it
and
defy
the
very
logic
i
used
with
my
wife
to
justify
coming
here
this
afternoon
i
have
really
been
searching
for
a
good
quality
diaper
bag
i
wanted
something
timeless
and
something
that
would
work
for
boy
or
girl
i
do
want
a
boy
i
looked
at
gucci
diaper
bags
too
expensive
for
what
you
get
and
they
are
i
like
gucci
because
their
items
are
covered
in
gs
and
well
my
last
name
is
gunderson
yeah
we
like
gucci
i
found
these
musicians
over
at
hitrecord
org
been
hanging
out
there
whenever
i
get
a
few
minutes
lately
mostly
listening
to
mix
of
interesting
music
hitrecord

is
an
open
collaborative
production
company
founded
by
joseph
gordon
levitt
where
anyone
can
share
their
ideas
creations
find
an
idea
make
something
other
folks
then
get
inspired
to
riff
off
of
that
creation
and
the
ball
just
keeps
rolling
everybody
feeds
off
each
other's
muses
and
all
sorts
of
fascinating
stuff
happens
if
you
look
at
brighton's
reflection
this
match
is
a
real
nail
biter
not
surprisingly
the
early
weeks
of
this
month
were
filled
with
conversations
about

this
quote
still
rings
true
today
it
is
very
possible
that
we
block
our
own
progress
by
refusing
to
recognize
the
truths
that
we
learn
about
ourselves
this
could
be
because
we
are
ashamed
of
what
we
have
done
or
have
not
done
this
could
be
because
we
do
not
feel
ready
to
accomplish
the
task
set
before
us
there
are
many
flurries
of
brain
activity
when
one
of
these
big
epiphany
moments
takes
place
it
is
our
responsibility
to
learn
to
take
a
moment
to
breathe
and
learn
how
to
deal
with
what
we
have
learned
once
we
are
able
to
process
the
news
we
are
then
capable
of
reaching
a
more
mature
conclusion
and
growth
can
take
place

there
are
some
things
on
there
that
aren

really
really
do
but
i
won

because
there

that
any
harry

fan
is
going
to
find
amazing
be
they
adult
or
child
die
hard
or
casual
there
truly
is
something
for
everyone
at
the
making
of
harry
potter
right
from
when
you
first
step
into
the
studio
foyer
and
are
greeted
with
photos
on
the
walls
above
of
the
principal
cast
members
from
across

years
as
well
as

it

with

the

in

of

the

weren

this
german
based
company
has
become
the
premier
supplier
for
many
ice
cream
cereal
and
candy
products
around
the
world
chances
are
good
that
you
ve
tasted
their
products
the
best
part
of
the
night
for
me
aside
from
the
part
where
in
my
head
i
decide
that
chef
ludo
himself
designed
the
night's
awesome
90s
hip
hop
playlist
was
my
vantage
point
overall
i
was
not
thrilled
with
the
space
lemon
moon
is
a
cafeteria
in
an
office
complex
and
the
ambiance
of
its
bright
spacious
dining
room
just
did
not
match
the
excitement
of
the
night
but
it
has
an
open
kitchen
and
from
my
seat
i
could
watch
as
one
chef
prepped
plate
after
plate
using
an
empty
glass
display
case
as
his
work
station
he
was
meticulous
about
every
detail
and
i
watched
as
chef
ludo
peered
intently
over
his
shoulder
hanging
on
every
drop
of
sauce
making
sure
each
dish
was
just
perfect
in
that
moment
all
the
ludobites
fanfare
made
sense
every
item
i
was
served
was
at
the
highest
level
chef
ludo
and
his
team
took
great
pains
to
achieve
harmony
from
a
wild
array
of
complex
flavors
to
make
every
plate
beautiful
a
world
of
mindful
effort
is
behind
every
bite
he
is
pulling
out
all
the
stops
putting
all
he
has
out
there
in
that
moment
i
totally
got
the
ludobitches
there
is
most
definitely
something
hot
about
a
man
who
works
so
hard
to
ensure
that
i
that
all
of
us
there
feel
taken
care
of
and
seriously
the
french
accent
does
not
hurt
either
this
meal
made
me
feel
taken
care
of
how
can
i
dare
act
too
cool
for
that
winner
maui
imperial
coconut
porter
instead
i
offer
owl
choices
whenever
possible
and
i
treat
questions
like
genuine
questions
if
i
say
can
i
have
that
he
is
allowed
to
say
yes
or
no
but
if
i
say
give
it
to
mommy
it
s
not
a
choice
but
i
don
t
pount
and
beg
and
make
a
fuss
while
he
delights
in
denying
me
as
dr
karp
recommends
one
winner

win

utter

and
yes
i
did
send
a
reply
tweet
about
spreading
bs
the
thing
about
twitter
is
it
a
platform
for
a
quick
hit
or
for
sending
out
information
via
attachments
but
a
blog
is
a
platform
of
more
permanent
and
more
permanently
findable
content
hence
i
use
both
and
use
both
in
the
manner
i
think
more
fitting
for
each
medium
the
titular
barbarian
of
a
barbarian
in
asia
is
henri
michaux
1889
1984
who
the
back
of
the
book
informs
us
was
a
great
french
poet
and
painter
who
set
out
as
a
young
man
to
see
the
far
east
the
barbarian
s
sensibility
is
certainly
poetic
he
is
interested
in
conveying
the
feelings
of
elsewhere
the
contours
of
its
sentimental
landscape
not
the
brute
facts
though
michaux
is
quite
conversant
in
eastern
literature
and
religion
he
sets
the
tone
on
the
opening
page
of
the
opening
section
a
barbarian
in
india
by
calling
calcutta
the
most
crowded
city
in
the
universe
is
calcutta
the
most
crowded
city
in
the
universe
impossible
to
be
certain
but
to
the
barbarian
in
india
it
certainly
feels
that
way
and
the
purpose
of
travel
as
opposed
to
tourism
is
to
feel
we
travel
to
feel
when
our
everyday
surroundings
have
made
us
numb
thread
a
cross
stitch
needle
with
a
thin
eye
with
metallic
thread
push
the
needle
up
through
the
first
hole
and
then
down
through
the
second
up
through
the
third
hold
and
back
down
into
the
second
then
back
up
through
the
fourth
repeat
this
pattern
for
the
whole
design
and
tape
the
ends
down
on
the
back
it
takes
a
little
time
but
the
result
is
worth
the
work
tip
paper
stitching
is
a
lot
like
back
stitching
in
cross
stitch

well
we

female

samiya

and
nesreen
najm
al

wrote
about
shaima

in
a
local
newspaper
as
a
result
the
two
reporters
were
referred
to
the
ministry
of
information
s
press
violation
committee
not
for
reporting
an
untruth
but
for
reporting
a
truth
that
the
ministry
views
as
threatening
to
national
unity
the
ministry
s
accusatory
letter
was
leaked
and
a
scanned
copy
made
the
rounds
on
social

where
many
pointed
out
that
the
two
reporters
were
not
the
only
ones
to
report
shaima
s
case
a
similar
report
by
a
male
reporter
was
published
in

newspaper
no
reports
have
surfaced
that
he
was
reprimanded

are
plans
afoot

part
series
starting
with

the
idea
sounds
reminiscent
of
conquest
of
the
planet
of
the

a
scientist
develops
a
super
intelligent
talking
ape
who
becomes
enraged
when
the

s

is
killed
caesar
begins
to
despise
humanity
particularly
their
abuse
of
simians
and
plots
a
revolt
said
revolt
should
lead
to
a
planet
ruled
by
apes
throughout
the
rest
of
the
proposed
series
i
had
204
people
leave
their

tasting

different
micro
plants
and
then
enjoying
them
incorporated
into
the
wonderful
creations
of
excellent
italian
chefs
is
always
an
unforgetable
experience
it
s
kind
of
funny
how
people
remember
the
great
times
during
their
times
of
loss
a
new

for
me
to
those
experiencing
that
chaos
i
wish
you
good
luck
and
i
really
do
hope
things
get
better
for
you
but
its
your
choice
whether
you
want
chaos
over
genuine
happiness

a
busy
day
finishing

for

make
sure
you
pop

if

then
spend
a
couple
of
hours
browsing
the

at

businesses
that
openly
display
an
endorsement

tell

you
think

have

who
feels
like
that

came
to
save
sinners
and
if
you
really
feel
you
are
the
worst
person
on
this
earth
that
is
all
the
more
reason
to
come
to
him
in
prayer
and
repentance
he
will
not
reject
you
that
he
promises
why
are
such
choices
so
overwhelming

it
just
me

does
anyone

for

20
minutes
or
until

omgoodness
but
yesterday
was
a
long
day
i
started
my
day
with
a
scary
nightmare
about
dinosaurs
not
barney
dinosaurs
not
land
before
time
dinosaurs
think
jurassic
park
dinosaurs
in
my
dream
we'd
found
a
way
to
bring
dinosaurs
back
and
about
3
of
them
ended
up
near
where
we
were
in
my
dream
my
hubby
was
not
too
pleased
about
that
why
did
you
bring
back
the
meat
eaters
he
wanted
to
know
so
we
all
ran
screaming
for
cover
it
was
my
family
and
i
and
a
few
others
the
t
rexes
yep
those
scray
ones
chased
us
while
we
ducked
for
cover
we
thought
we
were
safe
inside
this
low
ceilinged
room
but
they
managed
to
find
us
the
only
shelter
was
a
king
sized
bed
we
all
scrambled
for
it
but
there
was
not
room
for
everyone
i
was
under
it
and
i
managed
to
grab
one
or
two
of
my
kids
but
the
others
did
not
fit
about
that
time
my
alarm
went
off
and
i
woke
up
dang
scary
dream
permanent
disfigurement
or
so
exactly
the
same
as
before
cut
out
a
spiral
but
then
cut
a
wavy
edge
along
the
outer
edges
of
the
spiral
you
could
of
course
just
cut
the
spiral
with
a
wavy
edge
to
start
off
but
that
makes
the
base
wavy
too
and
it
is
then
harder
to
stick
down
nothing
compares
to
the
flavor
of
food
that
is
grown
in
healthy
soil
without
pesticides
and
allowed
to
grow
until
just
the
right
time

their
funny
feather
poofs
the
barnvelders
with
eggs
the
color
of
dark
chocolate
why
did
i
have
to
get
these
birds
out
of
all
the
possible
breeds
that
the
hatchery
carried
mommy
was
sad
because
she
had
read
that
the
pretty
sebrights
can
be
standoffish
and
flighty
quail
d
anvers
sweet
but
plain
does
this
mean
i
m
a
bad
mommy
then
i
thought
that
perhaps
this
was
a
cosmic
lesson
in
acceptance
and
love
i
pushed
that
disappointment
away
and
made
a
promise
i
am
your
mommy
and
i
will
love
you
no
matter
what
they
had
a
favourite
chair
so
have
i
so
have
lots
of
people
i
still
remember
the
feel
of
a
letter
in
my
hand
with
the
handwriting
expressing
personal
feelings
and
information
so
simply
with
nothing
more
than
a
pen
in
fact
the
wait
to
receive
a
letter
itself
was
so
joyful
and
you
would
feel
like
reading
the
letter
again
and
again
today
does
the
email
or
sms
give
us
the
same
joy
when
people
personally
write
by
hand
from
afar
the
letters
remind
us
that
somebody
somewhere
has
made
time
for
us
to
sit
and
patiently
write
to
us
today
it
is
the
age
of
the
computers
of
technology
ruling
the
lives
of
humanity
it
is
the
era
of
web
sites
and
emails
of
chats
online
and
portals
be
it
a
letter
or
an
article
one
makes
use
of
the
keyboard
as
it
faster
easier
and
more
convenient
one
does
not
have
to
worry
about
anything
else
where
does
that
leave
the
poor
pens
those
lovely
long
hand
instruments
from
start
to
finish
i
can
give
you
a
sneak
preview
without
spoilers
i
think
there
will
be
new
characters
of
course
but
the
ones
from
firebrand
will
still
be
very
much
centre
stage
conal
and
seth
haven
t
been
idle
over
the
centuries
and
they
certainly
haven
t
stayed
on
one
side
of
the
veil
and
it
s
their
habit
of
crossing
it
that
gets
them
into
trouble
at
the
beginning
of
bloodstone
one
incident
at
the
start
of
the
story
has
terrible
consequences
not
just
for
them
but
for
their
whole
family

i
think
new
writer
steven
moffat
has
a
big
challenge
following
such
a
successful
and
popular
doctor
but
he
s
an
excellent
choice
and
if
anyone
can
fill
russell
t
davies
shoes
then
he
s
the
man
to
do
it
no
the
problem
here
is
far
greater
than
individuals
and
institutions
it
is
all
about
 
the
system
 
and
from
my
view
point
the
system
is
failing
on
every
level
i
added
a
butterfly
by
k

i
got

in
2011
an
mou
it
was
a
sunny
but
still
cool
morning
with
a
wind
so
i
wore
a
long
sleeved
shirt
under
my
flowery
nuumuu
dress
i
had
planned
to
do
a
2
mile
warm
up
but
time
was
short
so
i
only
did
1
5
that
got
me
to
a
portapotty
so
i
was
able
to
use
that
at
the
last
minute
without
standing
in
line
my
grandmother
bognanno
she
was
an
amazing
woman
sooo
many
great
memories
of
her
and
you
scoop
her
up
because
the
day
she
will
not
want
that
ever
again
is
the
next
stage
before
heaven
and
sky
and
a
rumbling
earth
added
it
happens
in
short
track
cho
said
with
a
shrug
the
real
battle
was
between
me
and
jeff
when
you
are
playing
your
guitar
you
do
not
waste
time
wishing
its
out
of
tune
strings
were
in
tune
wondering
how
the
strings
got
out
of
tune
in
the
first
place
thinking
there
is
something
wrong
with
a
guitar
that
needs
tuning
you
just
tune
the
thing
and
get
on
with
your
song
it
is
not
a
moral
issue
the
guitar
does
not
need
counseling
or
coaching
or
a
12
step
program
to
help
it
stay
in
tune
what
it
needs
is
to
be
played
and
listened
to
tonight
i
will
draw
for
the
maple
syrup
bucket
and
announce
tomorrow
the
name
of
the
winner
my
word
what
a
machine
tell
us
what
it
is
and
how
it
works
you
re
over
your
last
relationship
your
signs
that
anger
and
resentment
have
to
be
gone
and
you
have
to
have
forgiven
not
only
your
ex
partner
but
yourself
to
be
angry
at
yourself
is
a
clear
sign
that
you
are
not
ready
to
move
forward
if
you
cannot
accept
where
you
are
and
who
you
are
right
now
then
it
s
time
to
make
a
change
you
will
know
that
you
are
ready
to
go
out
there
and
date
again
when
you
have
given
up
your
story
and
can
think
about
your
ex
with
neutrality
compassion
and
understanding
before
leaving
the
office
the
mom
shared
with
our
volunteer
that
a
week
ago
she
and
her
mother
had
made
the
decision
to
follow
christ
oh
and
about
that
return
game
and
letting
a
freshman
run
out
kicks
eight
yards
deep
evidently
that
was
a
collaborative
decision
the
incident
became
public
on
april
12
when
one
of
the
prostitutes
argued
with
a
secret
service
agent
over
her
payment
in

lunch
plate
of

i
think
the
adobo
pork
was
the
best
of
the
meal

love

the
goal
is
to
get
all
of
the

in
which
the

played
in

but
i
could
not
resist

we
were
there
for
two
hours
before
we
got
to
see
santa
she
had
played
on
every
toy
begged
for
every
piece
of
candy

ran

had
her
fun

she

my

on
the

to
some
out

who
are

a
similar
journey
the
feminist
movement
introduced
an
unbelievable
amount
of
tension
into
the
relationships
between
men
and
women
feminism
gave
us
women
permission
to
nag
and
criticize
our
husbands
which
most
women
can
do
just
fine
without
any
special
permission
the
legacy
of
the
feminist
movement
has
been
to
turn
the
home
which
should
be
the
place
of
cooperation
into
a
sphere
of
competition
between
men
and
women
and
ironically
feminism
which
was
supposed
to
be
about
getting
beyond
stereotypes
supported
the
most
negative
of
stereotypes
about
men

for

have
never
in
my
life
come
across
a
perfectly
healthy
human
being
thank
you
so
much
for
dropping
by
watching
them
i
found
myself
thinking
a
lot
about
and
his
love
for
us
he
has
a
bottomless
supply
of
patience
too
with
all
of
us
even
those
of
us
who
can
be
quite
challenging
without
further
ado
mr

walked
into
the
middle
of
the
ad

auditorium
unbidden
he
smiled
and
greeted
his
people
and
started
speaking
with
the
tone
of
an
entertaining
yet
earnest
story
teller
i
was
happy
i
read
it
out
of
order
regardless
because
you
already
know
that
the
first
two
women
have
happy
endings
and
are
continued
through
the
series
this
book
makes
me
want
to
pick
up
the
first
two
books
as
the
last
one
wraps
up
the
series

this

followers
forgive
me
if
i
go
over

on

but
be
thankful
you
are
not
listening
to
me
as
that
can
be
so
much
worse
africa
could
solve
the
problem
itself
and
this
needed
to
be
driven
strongly
by
the
south
african
government
and
the
continent's
bloc
with
immediate
action
needed
on
tuesday
brian
took
a
half
day
and
i
met
him
in
the
city
for
lunch
a
walk
some
beer
basically
a
date
we
had
lunch
at
the
belgium
cafe
owned
and
operated
by
the
people
from
monk's
cafe
in
center
city
monk's
is
known
as
one
of
the
best
beer
bars
in
the
world
i
kid
you
not
the
food
was
quite
tasty
but
my
jury
is
still
out
on
our
waitress
she
brought
some
unclean
cutlery
so
we
sent
it
back
when
she
returned
with
supposedly
new
knives
she
took
a
look
at
a
knife
then
wiped
it
across
her
and
placed
it
next
to
my
plate
i
really
wanted
to
say
you
know
i
am
right
here
right
an
afghan
man
who
fled
from
the
taliban
to
begin
a
new
life
in
australia
will
spend
the
next
14
years
behind
bars
after
a
judge
rejected
his
claim
that
cultural
differences
had
led
to
him
a
woman
i
made
my
way
down
to
the
ratway
and
snuck
inside
up
ahead
was
a
flickering
light
and
i
could
hear
two
voices
arguing
i
drew
my
bow
and
moved
forward
silently
i
dropped
the
first
s
wit
with
my
bow
before
he
could
even
understand
what
had
happened
when
his
friend
came
running
i
grabbed
my
longswords
and
charged
in
straight
at
him
the
fool
was
blundering
about
his
weapon
and
i
made
short
messy
work
of
him
just
in
case
i
grabbed
both
of
the
bodies
looted
them
and
then
dragged
them
into
the
campfire
to
burn
smelly
rats
the
receptionist
had
identified
her
and
the
doctor
this
time
a
woman
more
of
her
age
gestured
to
martha
to
accompany
her
swallowing
her
fear
because
fear
only
led
to
sleepless
nights
which
led
to
dark
saggy
eyes
martha
rose
and
strode
across
the
waiting
area
to
the
room
the
woman
had
indicated
eyes
fixed
firmly
on
door
in
front
of
her
before
the
doctor
could
follow
she
had
sat
herself
in
the
chair
opposite
the
desk
and
silently
prayed
she
didn
t
look
like
the

brought
in

a
substantial

for

so
how
do
we
relate
this
back
to
everyday
life
puree
everything
together
and
you
have
a
persilade
smell
the
green
summer
paste
chances
are
you
will
want
to
have
it
just
like
that

just
flip

you
do
not

to
do
this
salt

hey
for
example
was
a
quaint
by
way
in
liverpool
with
small
shops
dating
from
the
18th
century
but
to
planners
and
councillors
it
was
only
history
and
so
it
was
destroyed
overtime
for
a
railway
station
that
was
not
built
what
little
remains
of
liverpool
s
unique
character
and
community
spirit
is
still
under
threat
in
2005
the
government
issued
a
directive
to
destroy
20
000
habitable
homes
in
liverpool
and
thousands
more
elsewhere
to
be
replaced
by
largely
executive
style
homes
beyond
the
economic
reach
of
dispossessed
locals
whole
liverpool
neighbourhoods
are
still
being
flattened
and
their
often
unwilling
communities
compulsorily
dispersed
temperatures
and
humidity
soared
from
cool
moist
60
s
to
the
high
90
s
ticks
and
mosquitoes
are
out
in
droves
making
gardening
more
of
a
chore
than
bliss
mark
and
i
have
recently
planned
a
trip
to
aruba
we
were
going
to
wait
until
march
to
leave
but
mark
is
not
exactly
a
patient
man
he
wants
what
he
wants
now
besides
he
gets
a
little
antsy
in
the
winter
as
this
recent
post
has
shown
and
this
will
give
us
a
great
break
from
the
cold
dreary
monotony
of
the
chicago
winter
that
keeps
us
cooped
up
in
the
house
and
bored
in
the
back
rio
before
i
start
sounding
like
someone
with
a
geriatric
fetish
there
are
a
million
areas
that
are
just
out
of
bounds
and
what
s
funny
is
that
they
are
kept
out
of
bounds
by
the
same
people
who
say
that
there
are
no
new
ideas
i
have
to
go
on
does
it
make
any
difference
at
all
whether
you
read
wasted
or
not
will
it
make
you
think
differently
will
that
be
a
good
thing
or
not
the
afghan
interpreter
managed
to
drive
the
stolen
car
over
the
very
ramp
where
panetta
was
set
to
arrive
the
secretary
was
soon
diverted
to
another
ramp
and
let's
pre
empt
this
right
now
no
mom
i
am
not
going
to
start
gambling
with
real
money
and
bankrupt
myself
and
j
because
yes
i
know
that
is
wrong
plus
it
is
fake
money
not
real
also
add
on
sales
can
be
as
easy
as
mailing
out
to
existing
customers
the
hitrate
will
be
lower
but
the
effort
will
be
minimal
for
the
cash
earned
if
you
have
big
customers
few
customers
then
going
there
with
the
purpose
of
add
on
sales
is
not
frowned
up
on
but
actually
expected
in
this
way
you
will
do
a
customer
satisfaction
meeting
and
having
the
opportunity
to
expand
and
deepen
your
cooperation
with
the
customer
and
even
develop
new

said
customer
it
has
never
been
the
same
some
nights
we
would
wander
if
in
search
of
adventure
usually
ending
up
at
our
favorite
korean
karaoke
place
the
kenny
rogers
music
house
a
minivan
sized
photo
of
kenny
rogers
enticed
customers
into
the
establishment
which
on
the
inside
was
decorated
like
a
mall's
santa's
workshop
display
except
with
a
good
dozen
pokemon
statues
this
was
korea
and
it
was
awesome
the
justice
ministry
s
competition
strategy
makes
clear
that
the
nine
jails
being
put
out
to
tender
out
of
136
prisons
in
england
and
wales
are
only
a
first
wave
the
public
sector
is
expected
to
win
some
of
the
bids
those
in
the
business
chasing
career
fame
glory
and
riches
are
sometimes
able
to
get
there
much
quicker
if
they
are
the
architects
of
something
brand
new
the
whole
awards
shebang
compounds
this
situation
as
what
is
new
is
often
more
rewarded
than
what
is
familiar
on
sunday
we
went
to
the
ceramic
showcase
at
the
convention
center
in
portland
saw
some
inspiring
work
off
to
long
beach
washington
after
that
taking
hwy
30
along
the
columbia
river
to
astoria
it
was
a
lovely
leisurely
drive
on
a
perfect
sunny
day
our
destination
was
the
adrift
hotel
on
the
beach
at
long
beach
the
hotel
was
recently
remodeled
using
the
eco
friendly
up
cycling
ideas
i
think
that
crates
to
the
walls
for
shelving
is
not
very
creative
reminded
me
of
using
orange
crates
back
in
the
day
for
our
bookshelves
the
hotel
provided
free
use
of
beach
bikes
for
two
hours
off
we
went
for
1
1
2
hour
along
the
asphalt
path
through
the
beach
grass
we
attempted
a
ride
on
the
packed
sand
but
the
resistance
of
the
sand
as
well
as
riding
into
the
wind
proved
too
much
for
us
standing
firmly
before
my
foe
so
there
you
go
if
you
needed
some
inspiration
on
how
to
match
a
pair
of
envoy
shoes
send
us
how
you
match
your
envoy
shoes
we
d
love
to
check
it
out
i
am
not
sure
if
i
have
mentioned
before
but
he
is
a
serious
groper
he
gets
very
angry
with
me
if
i
stop
his
busy
hand
from
rubbing
and
running
anywhere
he
can
reach
this
is
a
big
issue
for
me
i
have
been
working
with
him
on
it
since
he
was
7
or
8
months
old
and
am
not
having
much
luck
any
time
i
have
worn
a
nursing
necklace
he
has
beaten
me
with
it
so
this
has
not
helped
i
usually
have
to
wear
a
tank
top
under
a
long
sleeved
shirt
to
limit
his
access
why
the
trouble
you
ask
because
the
sensation
is
so
uncomfortable
for
me
on
so
many
levels
it
gives
me
major
heebie
jeebies
and
always
has
it
is
just
too
much
touch
on
sensitive
skin
all
at
once
for
me
and
i
find
myself
gritting
my
teeth
just
to
get
through
it
when
i
was
with
allesandro
i
was
never
taken
care
of
and
he
had
a
way
of
kicking
me
down
with
his
words
this
dinner
and
movie
bit
was
great
because
i
got
answers
and
in
a
way
i
realized
i
am
over
him
when
deep
down
i
always
wondered
the
attraction
is
definitely
still
there
on
both
ends
but
there
s
the
been
there
done
that
phenomenon
that
sweeps
in
to
chaperone
the
evening
to
leave
you
realizing
that
the
closeness
you
feel
is
only
that
of
familiarity
meanwhile
mr
stomach
is
growing
hoarse
and
finally
just
flops
over
on
his
tattered
sofa
under
the
chute
that
always
spews
a
putrid
ooze
and
he
s
so
far
away
and
so
far
on
the
bottom
floor
that
lord
brain
doesn
t
hear
him
until
it
s
too
late
the
basement
is
trashed
rotten
garbage
is
trickling
though
the
doorways
and
he
is
completely
pushed
past
his
capacity
why
those
styles
my
ex
left
when
my
daughter
was
13
and
my
son
14
i
felt
abandoned
as
a
parent
i
didn
t
know
how
i
was
going
to
manage
two
teenagers
on
my
own
and
all
the
chores
i
panicked
at
the
thought
every
time
i
had
a
struggle
with
one
of
them
for
whatever
reason
i
felt
bitter
resentment
build
toward
my
ex
for
leaving
me
alone
to
deal
the
bang
bang
club
was
the
name
given
to
four
young
photographers
greg
marinovich
ryan
phillippe
kevin
carter
taylor
kitsch
ken
oosterbroek
and
joao
silva
whose
photographs
captured
the
final
days
of
white
rule
in
south
africa
two
were
awarded
pulitzer
prizes
for
their
acclaimed
work
the
film
tells
the
remarkable
and
sometimes
harrowing
story
of
these
young
men
and
the
extraordinary
extremes
they
went
to
in
order
to
capture
their
pictures
anna
malin
akerman
is
their
photo
editor
who
looked
out
for
them
protected
them
and
made
sure
their
photographs
were
seen
across
the
world
it
may
seem
like
such
a
simple
thing
to
make
me
so
overly
jubilant
but
through
the
adoption
journey
the
smallest
blessing
from
can
be
the
largest
source
of
joy
they
remind
us
that
he
is
writing
our
story
suddenly
our
path
does
not
seem
so
long
our
destination
not
so
far
away
the
photographs
extend
his
four
horseman
of
the
apocalypse
series
again
we
have
isolated
figures
in
stadiums
on
basketball
courts
but
unlike
the
video
work
which
has
a
creepy
spectral
feel
the
figures
in
the
photographs
take
on
sort
of
prophetic
magnitude
with
the
crowd
trained
on
them
they
appear
as
figures
with
answers
the
best
photo
work
of
the
show
is
of
a
child
born
aloft
and
focused
upon
by
spectators
and
cameras
in
reality
this
must
be
the
son
of
a
star
basketball
player
in
pfeiffer
s
world
the
little
boy
s
presence
is
amped
and
exalted
like
a
golden
calf
steep
your
life
in
reality
and
so
when
he
focuses
on
his
classes
which
he
loooves
and
when
he
has
plans
green
onions
or
chives
in
years
past
i
gather
bossman
would
regularly
ditch
the
old
machinery
to
keep
the
fleet
svelte
clearly
the
dive
in
business
has
delayed
or
cancelled
his
plans
in
that
area
trouble
is
that
the
competition
there
are
two
or

this

might
get
a
little
nerdy
about
electricity
and
such
also
i
am
not
an
electrical
engineer
so
i
make
no
claims
as
to
the
accuracy
of
any
statement
in
this
post
the
set
up
mr
feitelbaum
the
head
of
the
family
that
is
largely
the
subject
of
gross
 
nize
baby
comic
and
book
of
the
same
name
encounters
a
scale
that
will
refund
his
coin
if
he
guesses
his
weight
correctly
i
remember
there
was
a
scale
like
this
in
my
childhood
hometown
baton

louisiana
i
understand
mr
feitelbaum's
attraction
to
the
wager
in
the
first
panel
gross
draws
a
hilarious
little
dust
cloud
a
symbol
from
the
cartooning
lexicon
meaning
swift
movement
his
cloud
is
a
lively
scrawl
even
his
drawing
of
the
coin
op
scale
is
funny
with
the
perspective
as
goofy
as
his
character's
speech
and
thinking
it
is
as
if
the
visuals
we
see
are
all
influenced
by
the
nuttiness
of
the
cross
eyed
characters
the
homeowner
what
i
did
not
realize
was
what
a
psychological

that

than
one

a

of
my
co
workers
aka
my
best
friends
would
not
be
coming
back
to

this
summer
my

was
much
needed
to
calm
me
down
from
the

out
i
was
having
buying

also
helped
calm

when

find
this
particularly
refreshing
because
i
grew
up
in

and
moved
to
the
deserts
of

when
i
was
a
teenager
i
remember
landing
at
the
airport
in
tucson
and
feeling
the
eyes
of
half
of
the
terminal
staring
at
me
and
my
family
eventually
i
got
used
to
being
the
only
person
in
my
school
who
didn
t
speak
english
yet
the
only
asian
kid
in
my
class
and
just
generally

a
few
years
later
when
i
arrived
in
san
francisco
to
go
to
college
standing
at
the
luggage
terminal
i
felt
an
odd
comfort
for
the
first
time
in
a
long
time
absolutely
nobody
was
staring
at

from

to

with

after

were
killed
in

kate
is
a

girl
who
spends
a
lot
of
time
alone
reading
and
is
still
coming
to
terms
with
the
loss
of
her
parents
georgia
however
deals
with
things
in
a
different
way
she
is
outgoing
and
has
a
great
social
life
it
is
georgia
who
suggests
that
kate
should
leave
the
house
to
do
her
reading
so
that
she
might
actually
meet
people
when
kate
takes
her
advice
and
meets
the
handsome
vincent
she
has
no
idea
how
much
her
life
is
about
to
change
power

almost
identical

too

of

it

i
started
posting

i
broke
up
with
him
during
the
time
i
am
in
love
with
him
i
called
it
quits
not
because
i
doubted
his
love
for
me
rather
my
whims
of
a
relationship
had
not
been
fed
what
s
worse
to
think
now
is
i
loved
him
much
more

the
both
of
us
were
already
apart
don

confusion
buys
time
in

the
trip
cost
us
less
than
we
expected
it
to
and
we
managed
to
get

without
any

hassle
it
was
a
good
night
for
the

several

members
have
tentatively
voiced

even

have
openly
decried

it

crisp
too
bright

however
described
the
preview
in
a
slightly
more
positive
light
the
cinematic
filter
between
the
action
and
the
audience
is
dissolved
in
favor
of
a
more
immediate
lens
on
the
world
of
the
movie
he
said
dyanne
it
was
funny
cause
i
thought
we
were
just
going
to
this
club
in
los
angeles
to
discuss
business
i
hadn
t
put
two
and
two
together
about
the
fact
that
we
were
going
to
meet
the
guy
that
my
friend
was
trying
to
set
me
up
with
when
i
met
howard
we
just
hit
it
off
right
away
but
we
were
both
very
busy
i
was
going
out
of
town
to
do
stage
work
he
was
going
out
of
town
to
perform
his
musical
act
but
we
stayed
in
touch
we
wrote
letters
to
each
other
for
over
a
year
every
week
we
got
married
not
long
after
that
and
we
ve
been
together
ever
since
another
interesting
panel
covered
publicity
reviewing
social
media
panelists
shared
what
is
worked
for
them
or
their
clients
and
pointed
out
that
30
minutes
a
day
in
10
minute
intervals
was
enough
time
to
spend
with
social
networking
the
new
terms
of
service
for
pinterest
came
up
and
it
was
recommended
as
the
new
big
thing
i
am
not
going
there
yet

be

recognition

day

in

it
s
that
time
of
year
again
for
award
show
nominations
then
there
was
dr
sumner
jackson
as
the
chief
medical
director
of
the
american
hospital
he
tended
to
the
sounds
of
thousands
of
french
american
and
british
during
the
war
but
his
greatest
contribution
was
in
hiding
many
of
the
military
men
shot
down
who
made
their
way
to
the
hospital
until
they
could
be
helped
back
to
england
to
fight
again
as
i
briefly
pondered
if
it
was
a
wise
choice
to
blow
40
on
a
book
when
i
m
trying
so
hard
to
go
paperless
at
home
i
realized
the
tome
was
a
little
piece
of
inspiration
to
take
home
with
me
and
representative
of
not
just
what
i
love
about
books
but
what
i
love
about
the
met
just
as
the
brothers
grimm
discovered
there
truly
are
stories
all
around
us
some
from
the
past
some
of
the
moment
and
some
to
be
created
but
they
are
there
for
us
to
explore
or
escape
in
if
we
open
ourselves
up
to
them
perhaps
beyond
ancient
scrolls
and
priceless
works
of
art
this
concept
was
the
real
takeaway
from
our
day
at
the
met
go
there
and
let
your
imagination
take
you
wherever
you
want
to
go
clearly
a
lesson
not
just
for
a
fifth
grader
think
what
would
he
do
if
it
were
him
he
d
go
south
north
was
suicide
but
he
didn
t
know
he
didn
t
know
benjamin
who
did
nothing
is
good
for
my
parents
he
d
said
he
didn
t
seem
to
even
care
that
paris
wouldn
t
be
bombed
we
are
all
made
to
worship
to
experience
and
live
lives
of
love
obedience
and
surrender
to
that
flow
from
our
relationship
with
him
this
is
what
worship
is
really
all
about
read
from
my
mt
tbr
pile
of
doom
he
said
that
it
is
because
the
irish
feel
very
close
to
their
history
and
the
o'neills
were
great
fighters
against
the
english
and
are
cherished
for
it
to
this
day
of
course
none
of
this
is
convincing
to
protestants
who
made
up
their
theological
minds
before
consulting
scripture
once
people
do
that
cries
for
basing
everything
on
holy
writ
become
basically
meaningless
exercises
in
polemics
scripture
should
mold
us
not
the
other
away
around
at
the
very
least
for
this
article
to
say
that
purgatory
is
repugnant
to
scripture
is
simply
wrong
you
can
argue
that
maybe
these
verses
do
not
support
the
doctrine
of
purgatory
but
the
bible
never
clearly
says
purgatory
is
a
repugnant
doctrine
unto
the
lord
at
best
it
is
a
stalemate
devoured
with
passion
enjoyed
with
a
fervor

after
a
lecture
on
the
brain
development
which
i
attended
in
the
library
last
evening
i
was
speaking
to
a
47
year
old
man
from
the
audience
who
had
a
20
year
old
son
this
nice
man
named
william
was
telling
me
how
disappointed
he
was
that
his
son
was
decided
not
to
attend
college
he
said
that
it
was
his
dream
that
his
son
did
not
make
the
same
mistake
he
had
evening
follows
on
your
name
the
recipe
said
to
add
all
ingredients
stir
and
then
cook
for
about
3
hours
and
continue
to
stir
occasionally
easy
peasy
now
this
also
means
that
we
are
going
to
be
using
scaled
measurements
here
i
gotta
do
it
in

might
as

i
don

they
were
barely

them
in

had
to

a

beyond

little

the

tile
so

you
are

right
now
are
not

deceit
misplaced
desire
and
fat
lies
i
know
i
know
i
am
freakishly
obsessed
with
wicked
i
simply
can
not
help
it
sorry
if
it
bugs
you
or
if
you
are
getting
tired
of
my
incessant
ranting
but
as
promised
here's
the
scoop
on
roberta
valentini
i
only
had
to
let
the
stuff
dry
for
5
minutes
so
next
i
was
immediately
onto
the
best
part
we
have
lots
of
leftover
old
master's
wiping
stain
in
dark
walnut
from
when
we
stained
our
original
farmhouse
soft
maple
hardwood
floors
this
past
fall
so
we
used
up
another
can
of
that
on
this
table
what
i
will
highlight
below
is
just
a
sampling
of
the
errors
and
sleight
of
hand
deployed
by
bob
sungenis
in
the
defense
of
his
neo
geocentrism
i
hope
you
ll
begin
to
see
the
patterns
so
you
can
more
easily
spot
these
ploys
if
you
run
across
them
in
his
writings
again
just
ask
yourself
this
question
is
this
someone
who
is
really
just
in
this
for
the
truth
or
is
this
someone
who
will
say
anything
in
order
to
win
an
argument
as
fully
documented
in
dr
emil
besetzny's
book
sphinx
1873
however
the
most
outstanding
case
must
surely
be
the
creation
of
ten
living
homunculi
in
a
mere
five
weeks
accomplished
by
two
austrian
alchemists
from
the
late
16th

i

when

we
decide
that
we

i
almost
felt
reading

be
superfluous

when
you

you

you

decided
this
was
one
time
when
it
was
worth
seeing
for
myself
what
all
the
fuss
was
about
ice
ice
i
tell
you
not
like

right

to

his

lost
her
mind
too
happy
thursday
lovelies
if
the
portrait
of
benjamin
franklin
by
evert
duyckinick
portrays
a
fatherly
image
it
is
because
this
is
the
impression
the
artist
is
trying
to
capture
the
wise
and
benevolent
father
penned
by
benjamin
franklin
the
autobiography
literally
and
metaphorically
is
contextualized
in
a
father
son
interrelationship
the
fact
that
this
memoir
is
addressed
to
franklin
s
son
and
that
his
much
advocated
virtues
of
self
improvement
industry
and
truthfulness
originate
from
his
father
evince
the
framework
of
the
father
son
interrelationship
moreover
metaphorically
the
fact
that
franklin
reaches
heavenward
heavenly
father
for
a
higher
moral
perfection
also
supports
this
father
son
interrelational
framing
of
the
text
the
accounts
of
franklin
s
life
in
the
autobiography
testify
of
the
benefits
he
reaped
by
heeding
to
the
teachings
of
his
earthly
father
as
well
as
the
blessings
he
received
by
abiding
by
the
precepts
of
his
heavenly
father
perhaps
what
is
most
memorable
is
that
franklin
by
writing
the
autobiography
has
tried
to
inculcate
his
private
and
public
male
progeny
his
son
and
the
sons
of
america
the
characteristics
of
an
admirable
american
man
the
very
virtues

today
was
a

day
of

with
dinah
we
began
with
grooming
and
then
a
hand
walk
it
had
been
raining
and
dinah
was
kind
of
wet
so
i
wanted
her
to
dry
before
i
put
her
saddle
on
after
the
hand
walk
i
worked
on
walking
her
all
around
the

led
her
through
the

into

on

i
dragged
a

around
while
i
was
leading
her
just
trying

do
all
kinds
of
things
to
get
her
ready
to
handle

i

her
to

practiced
doing
a

on

keeping
her

feet
on
the

stair
it
took
a

work
and
patience

once
she
figured
out
what
i
wanted
she
was
really
good
was
the
title
of

sad

that

quite

retreat

offers
ever
since
i
was
in
my
30
s
i
thought
i
had
a
book
in
the
making
about
our
relationship
the
first
working
title
was
when
the
old
bat
dies
but
i
kind
of
figured
i
d
have
to
soften
that
i
didn
t
think
anybody
would
want
to
read
that
over
the
years
i
ve
imagined
writing
this
book
and
started
bits
and
pieces
of
it
several
times
over
i
called
it
when
the
old
bat
dies
because
every
time
i
d
think
to
myself
when
will
i
ever
feel
good
enough
or
when
will
i
stop
feeling
invisible
or
even
something
as
simple
as
when
will
i
be
able
to
accept
a
simple
compliment
about
my
hair
the
answer
was
always
when
the
old
bat
dies
both
the
writing
and
i
were
very
angry
for
a
long
time
and
now
that
i

on
the

side
of
her
death
i
ve
spent
some

examining

made
her

she
was

there

to
keep
quiet
i
feel
for
the
guy
but
i
will
be
laughing
about
this
for
months
i
didn
t
think
anything
could
beat
the
story
of
my
brother
fishing
with
his
son
that
ended
with
them
at
the
doctor
s
office
seems
as
though
when
my
nephew
cast
his
line
he
caught
something
a
little
bigger
than
he
was
expecting
that
would
be
his
father
the
hook
went
into
my
brother
s
nose
i

still
laughing

that
one

got
some
sore

i
know
tomorrow
is
going

be
even
worse
for
those
but
i
don

mind
the
pain
i
know
it
s
because
i
worked
those
muscles
and
they
are
letting
me
know
it
does
however
when
you
are
constantly
following

around

lifting
him

my

the
democrats
don
t
benefit
from
this
this
close
to
the
election
it
puts
them
on
the
defensive
even
if
you
argue
that
it
seems
that
the
ethics
investigation
process
is
working
the
democrats
having
to
defend
the
process
at
this
time
doesn
t
help
the
party
it
s
hurtful
because
it
gives
the
republicans
a
chance
to
say
see
the
democrats
have
all
those
problems
over
there
i
don
t
know
if
they
ll
do
that
because
they
re
a
lot
of
republicans
that
have
been
investigated
but
there
s
nothing
positive
in
this
for
the
democrats

shows

you

think
that

would
have
been

you
d
be

there
is

make

that

via

made
it

who
made

both
are

behind
in

try

continental
drift
is
the
most
disinterested
of
the
six
very
long
tracks
on
this
album
it
sounds
like
a
ship's
mast
creaking
with
ocean
waves
a
ride
cymbal
and
a
static
but
strangely
urgent
synth
chord
that
sustains
itself
for
the
length
of
the
track
and
brilliantly
brings
out
the
actual
pitch
of
the
creaking
ship's
mast
it
is
a
very
cool
but
excessively
long
track
it
is
followed
immediately
by
the
funky
burbling
groove
of
opening

which
is
oddly
enough
saved
from
monotony
by
the
sudden
appearance
of

life
is
a
journey
between
destinations
sometimes
all
that
i
can
see
is
the
destination
and
i
forget
to
appreciate
the
journey
i
can
get
so
absorbed
and
focused
with
where
i
m
headed
or
want
to
be
headed
that
my
eyes
and
mind
blur
out
the
time
in
between
sometimes
i
want
to
just
tune
out
during
my
in
betweens
i
don
t
want
to
be
there
and
i
m
going
to
try
and
sleep
my
way
through
until
the
end
but
life
occurs
during
the
in
between
times
if
i
don
t
pay
attention
during
that
time
i
will
miss
out
on
most
of

terraforming
contemporary

my
sister
has
been
posting
that
her
middle
child
the
boy
who
creates
havoc
w
all
of
the
kids
whenever
we
all
get
together
says
he
is
getting
picked
on
at
school
and
she
is
fuming
mad
at
the
principal
my
bro
politely
commented
that
his
son
said
the
same
thing
before
and
in
the
end
they
found
out
he
was
actually
the
one
causing
the
problems
my
sister
apparently
is
one
of
those
parents
who
thinks
their
kid
can
do
no
wrong
oy
vey
and
after
reading
all
of
her
other
posts
i
am
quite
sure
her
house
must
be
sparkling
clean
because
that
is
all
she
talks
about
or
that
someone
is
sick
or
that
she
is
just
bought
the
kids
some
new
cloths
i
know
i
know
it
is
a
free
country
people
can
post
whatever
they
like
but
really
shut
the
up
already
that
is
my
whining
for
the
week
ah
one
of
my
favorite
movies
ever
i
used
to
watch
this
all
the
time
on
tv
it
was
one
of
usa's
favorite
movies
for
a
while
there
too
and
liked
it
as
a
fun
action
flick
but
when
i
watched
it
as
i
was
older
and
was
looking
at
movies
in
a
different
way
i
saw
this
movie
in
a
completely
different
way
too
this
is
a
movie
with
a
big
heart
and
a
very
emotional
story
to
tell
it
is
not
just
about
guns
and
blowing
things
up
or
gary
oldman
acting
like
a
although
that
is
always
fun
to
watch
natalie
portman
delivers
one
of
the
best
movies
of
her
whole
career
even
though
she
was
only
11
years
old
and
it
was
her
first
movie
she
and
jean
reno
are
beautiful
together
and
they
and
luc
besson
the
director
created
something
very
special
with
this
movie
love
it
to
death
katie
s
grandma
and
her
mother
used
to
be
my
pets
too
i
saw
her
evolve
from
being
a
kitten
to
being
a
mother
herself
up
close
as
i
mentioned
earlier
coming
home
will
never
be
the
same
again
without
her
warm
welcome
from
the
start
i
know
that
my
pet
s
situation
is
precarious
i
know
she
ll
most
likely
die
but
seeing
her
helplessly
moaning
because
of
pain
is
totally
unbearable
for
me
she
may
have
died
in
the
end
but
at
least
i
know
i
did
what
i
can
to
try
to
save
her

they
need
and
treasure
without
the
frills
especially
if
they
are
only
shopping
within
a
10
km
radius
or
less
when
she
went
to
her
regular
appointment
on
july
5
at
vanderbilt
they
decided
to
put
her
into
the
hospital
for
a
few
days
for
tests
the
tests
included
various
ct
scans
an
mri
of
her
brain
and
visits
with
the
ear
nose
and
throat
doctors
who
used
a
scope
to
examine
her
nasal
passages
and
throat
they
found
no
structural
problems
a
spinal
tap
was
also
performed
the
last
visit
was
with
a
speech
pathologist
who
suggested
that
there
were
issues
in
the
soft
palate
and
her
epiglottis
was
probably
not
opening
and
closing
properly
no
further
diagnosis
was
made
at
this
point
however
she
seemed
to
improve
slightly
over
the
3
or
4
days
she
was
in
the
hospital
so
she
was
released
while
the
doctors
pondered
the
test
results
about
the
only
thing
they
had
to
say
at
this
point
was
to
voice
the
opinion
that
this
new
set
of
problems
probably
was
surprisingly
unrelated
to
her
bone
marrow
problems
we
were
so
excited
for
our
engagement
session
with
dana
grant
i
have
known
dana
for
a
couple
years
now
and
she
is
one
of
the
most
talented
photographers
that
i
have
ever
seen
worked
with
she
did
our
family
pictures
a
few
years
ago
and
then
i
also
had
her
take
my
graduation
pictures
i
love
her
and
she
is
soo
easy
to
work
with
i
can
not
wait
for
her
to
shoot
our
wedding
active

i
also
grabbed
a

pack
of
red
hook
winter
hook
because
it
was
on
sale
at
heb
i
really
do
not
understand
why
red
hook
went
with
this
particular
recipe
it
is
a
particularly
unexceptional
beer
which
is
not
to
say
it
is
not
good
just
not
spectacular
most
breweries
like
to
really
whip
out
da
bomb
for
a
special
release
and
this
just
is
not
it
that
said
you
can
rest
assured
i
will
finish
the
12
perhaps
carden
s
buyers
were
in
a
hurry
he
had
what
they
wanted
so
he
saved
them
time
maybe
carden
looks
like
a
trustworthy
fellow
had
a
big
smile
on
his
face
and
his
buyers
got
some
value
out
of
his
charm
or
maybe
they
saw
him
speak
the
day
before
and
thought
that
he
was
up
to
something
clever
so
they
thought
they
d
play
along

wide

only

we
are
not
even
quite
sure
what
the
allure
of
jack
falstaff
is
we
will
call
it
the
 
james
ormsby
je
ne
sais
quoi
factor
 
the
attraction
is
certainly
not
the
look
of
the
space
hidden
behind
a
sleek
industrial
doorway
the
interior
is
modern
but
ordinary
dressed
in
velvetines
and
sagemint
greens
that
could
have
jumped
straight
from
the
pages
of
a
west
elm
catalogue
the
ambience
fares
well
from
the
low
highly
polished
dark
wooden
ceiling
that
subdues
the
sound
allowing
a
dinner
conversation
to
flow
with
ease
thereby
helping
to
keep
the
dining
experience
a
relaxing
affair
creating
a
melting
of
freaky
blended
humanity
in
all
white
countries
is
an
act
of
genocide
today
is
my
blog
anniversary
and
i'd
like
to
celebrate
with
a
very
special
recipe
for
a
special
occasion
i'd
also
like
to
thank
blog
visitors
from
all
over
the
world
for
making
me
believe
i
am
doing
the
right
thing
the
making
of
these
pages
is
not
the
easiest
task
you
need
to
bake
take
photos
edit
photos
write
translate
it
is
very
time
consuming
and
it
develops
at
a
much
slower
pace
than
the
one
i
had
in
mind
when
i
was
starting
but
never
mind
the
most
important
thing
is
you
are
enjoying
it
and
i
am
enjoying
it
so
let's
get
down
to
business
is

a
bit
pricey
and
crazy
for
ten
super
sized
baskets
yes
and
no
they
were
the
cheapest
option
for
the
expedits
but
absolutely
not
inexpensive
although
i
felt
like
i
won
the
lottery
when
i
found
them
for
50
off
and
i
am
positive
they
will
hold
up
for
the
long
haul
not
to
mention
that
someday
when
my
boys
are
too
big
to
want
and
need
a
playroom
these
babies
can
be
recycled
to
the
garage
laundry
room

or
even
sold

what
was
the
best
book
you
read
it
is
a
tidy
bit
of
verbal
sleight
of
hand
that
accomplishes
two
objectives
at
once
first
it
subtly
acknowledges
the
little
secret
that
anyone
with
eyes
can
see
but
no
one
wants
to
say
out
loud
that
the
internet
has
thus
far
been
a
weak
advertising
medium
but
it
cleverly
tries
to
make
the
preposterous
case
that
this
weakness
is
actually
a
strength
that
web
advertising
specifically
content
marketing
and
social
media
are
more
effective
because
of
their
low
impact

5
observations
from
this
week
till
next
time
why
have
you
rejected
me
great
stories
these
are
not
so
great
decisions
we
ll
say
things
like
oh
we
re
getting
to
know
each
other
still
or
who
that
guy
sure
we
ve
been
on
a
couple
dates
but
it
s
nothing
serious
yet
and
if
you
re
stuck
in
1999
and
still
thinking
that
love
jones
is
how
you
should
model
a
relationship
you
might
even
say
something
like
oh
we
re
just
kicking
it
but
when
anyone
makes
the
mistake
of
jumping
you
two
to
the
dating
stage
too
soon
somehow
you
find
a
way
to
shut
that
down
quickly
but
workers
do
not
just
support
retired
people
they
support
all
non
workers
including
their
children
and
their
spouse
or
partner
if
they
do
not
work
even
as
the
number
of
retirees
is
growing
family
size
is
shrinking
so
over
those
next
few
decades
even
as
the
ratio
of
workers
to
retirees
is
expected
to
go
down
the
ratio
of
workers
to
non
workers
is
expected
to
go
up
the
burden
on
workers
will
be
much
that
same
it
is
just
that
in
effect
some
portion
of
that
burden
will
have
shifted
from
supporting
their
children
to
supporting
their
parents
thanks
to
arlene
christmas
that
headed
the
fundraising
when
a
good
history
of
the
george
w
bush
years
is
finally
written
his
breakthrough
with
india
may
turn
out
to
be
the
most
important
foreign
policy
initiative
of
his
administration
the
indian
ocean
hosts
lanes
for
the
oil
from
the
persian
gulf
and
an
ever
larger
share
of
its
trade
and
india
sits
in
the
middle
of
it
it
is
also
the
geographical
center
of
transnational
islamic
terrorism
it
is
essential
that
the
united
states
maintain
a
strong
deterrent
in
the
indian
ocean
and
that
it
preserve
and
enhance
its
ability
to
coerce
whatever
clown
happens
to
be
governing
pakistan
at
the
moment
india
is
the
key
to
both
that
barack
obama
recognizes
this
is
to
his
credit
it
is
quite
possibly
the
most
deft
foreign
policy
move
of
his
administration
admittedly
a
low
standard
and
he
deserves
credit
for
it
before
i
go
any
further
let
me
take
a
moment
to
say
everything
that
happens
to
a
believer
is
either
caused
or
allowed
by
jim
will
discuss
a
biblical
examination
of
the
queen
of
heaven
s
messages
in
the
end
times
tens
of
millions
visit
apparition
sites
hoping
to
encounter
mary
the
mother
of
jesus
many
believe
these
increasing
manifestations
signal
the
advent
of
a
new
era
on
earth
thousands
of
messages
from
the
apparition
of
mary
indicate
that
we
are
entering
a
critical
moment
in
world
history
cataclysmic
changes
may
soon
occur
those
who
follow
the
apparitions
believe
mary
has
come
to
turn
us
back
to
while
others
insist
that
these
events
are
either
fabrications
or
the
working
of
satan
messages
from
heaven
tests
these
messages
in
light
of
scripture
and
seeks
to
answer
the
following
questions
why
does
the
queen
of
heaven
appeal
to
so
many
what
is
her
relation
to
the
roman
catholic
church
are
the
queen
s
messages
heaven
sent
does
the
word
of
reveal
the
origin
of
these
phenomena
does
the
bible
anticipate
apparitions
signs
and
wonders
in
the
last
days
how
might
the
mother
of
the
eucharist
transform
the
world
in
the
third
millennium
why
does
the
queen
center
all
attention
on
the
eucharist
jim
tetlow
reviews
volumes
of
apparitional
messages
searching
for
the
common
thread
that
ties
all
these
events
together
he
presents
a
thorough
and
fair
treatment
of
what
may
well
be
the
most
prolific
series
of
supernatural
events
in
history

messages
from

i
actually
get
butterflies
in
my
stomach
even
with
the
thought
of
having
to
make
a
phone
call
be
it
as
petty
as
calling
my
best
buddy
to
getting
anything
organised
by
calling
the
help
desk
of
any
utility
now
you
can
guess
it
well
how
severe
my
state
is
i
decided
to
write
about
it
to
be
able
to
get
a
clearer
picture
of
what
exactly
has
been
causing
all
this
in
past
years
i
m
not
an
adrenaline
in
fact
i
m
a
bit
of
a
scaredy
cat
about
some
things
like
heights
3
eggs
separate
the
sparrow
shrieks
and
swallow
songs
it
is
with
thanks
and
wonderment
that
when
we
see
the
contribution
made
by
so
many
individuals
to
the
success
of
the
30x30x30
challenge
project
for
the
benefit
of
our
children
we
see
great
hope
and
a
promise
for
our
future

resolve
to
say
something

2
tsps
of
garam
masala
adjust
acc
to
ur
taste
it
is
a
tradition
at
our
house
to
celebrate
with
cheese
fondue
this
is
an
ideal
meal
very
social
easy
to
prepare
and
little
cleaning
up
work
afterwards
paving
the
way
ready
for
an
evening
of
entertainment
as
well
as
present
opening
the
 
surprises
 
are
opened
one
for
one
first
the
 
tongue
in
cheek
 
poem
is
read
aloud
and
then
the
package
is
opened
to
reveal
the
gift
s
the
exchange
of
regular
presents
is
equally
commonplace
the
presents
are
not
generally
extravagant
but
this
does
not
in
any
way
detract
from
the
occasion
on
the
contrary
my
husband
has
been
shocked
to
see
the
way
christmas
presents
are
opened
in
england
in
just
minutes
flat
parcels
are
ripped
open
with
increasing
frenzy
the
contents
carelessly
tossed
aside
without
a
glance
he
was
also
astonished
to
find
out
that
a
visit
to
santa
claus
if
he
could
be
found
was
relatively
expensive
actually
he
was
quite
disillusioned
with
 
christmas
 
keep

one
thing
that
is
not
including
in
shrigley
watson
definition
is
the
means
or
method
of
how
the
end
of
exploitation
and
cruelty
will
be
achieved
it
does
not
specify
non
violence
nor
does
it
advocate
pro
violence
it
simply
encourages
us
to
do
it
not
how
subsequently
the
party
of
the
first
part
did
observe
with
some
degree
of
wonder
and
or
disbelief
a
miniature
sleigh
hereinafter
the
vehicle
being
pulled
and
or
drawn
very
rapidly
through
the
air
by
approximately
eight
8
reindeer
the
driver
of
said
vehicle
appeared
by
all
accounts
to
be
and
it
is
hereby
asserted
was
in
fact
the
aforementioned
claus
angela
duckworth
assistant
professor
at
penn
sums
it
up
here
s
why
learning
is
hard
true
learning
is
fun
exhilarating
and
gratifying
but
it
is
also
often
daunting
exhausting
and
sometimes
discouraging
to
help
chronically
low
performing
but
intelligent
students
educators
and
parents
must
first
recognize
that
character
is
at
least
as
important
as
intellect
you
know
the
demented
psychotic
blind
fools
praising
the
anc
government
for
supposedly
building
houses
for
illegal
immigrants
and
supplying
electricity
which
is
never
paid
for
by
those
previously
disadvantaged
never
care
to
tell
the
other
side
of
the
story
like
the
liberal
socialist
left
the
truth
remains
a
scarce
commodity
our
home
was
filled
with
people
today
on
a
rolling
basis
some
in
some
out
all
day
long
it
is
lovely
having
so
much
life
laughter
and
happiness
surrounding
us
life
is
short
and
precious
we
have
to
make
the
most
of
every
living
moment
see
the
positive
in
all
that
is
set
before
us
peace
and
greens
i
am
so
sorry
for
my
lack
of
diligence
t
t
i
guess
i
could
just
never
bring
myself
to
write
about
anything
i
have
been
updating
my
personal
blog
a

more
often

one
beer
that
i
have
 
researched
 
more
than
others
recently
is
a
new
offering
from
one
of
my
favourite
scottish
breweries
fyne
ales
it
is
their
west
highland
black
ipa
whbipa
and
for
the
past
few
weeks
it
is
been
making
an
appearance
in
the
three
judges
the
bon
accord
the
state
bar
and
the
laurieston
the
plan
was
to
drive
further
north
to
see
the
real
tundra
perhaps
camp
there
for
a
day
or
two
and
visit
deadhorse
with
a
potential
tour
of
prudho
bay
and
what
do
you
know
as
soon
as
we
crossed
a
very
scary
looking
mountain
pass
the
weather
started
clearing
up
when
we
reached
the
north
plateau
it
was
actually
quite
pleasant
sunny
with
clouds
the
wast
expanse
if
flat
tundra
on
both
sides
of
the
road
there
were
even
some
small
hills
with
some
snow
on
them
nice
it
would
be
interesting
to
cam
there
for
a
couple
of
days
well
assuming
the
weather
stays
like
this
however
it
would
probably
be
quite
boring
to
just
walk
for
miles
on
flat
terrain
mosquitoes
and
tussock
and
all
that
water
probably
won
t
let
it
be
boring

thank
you
for
being
along
for
the
ride
dear
golddigger
ever
since
yesterday's
post
in
between
drawing
writing
and
watching
star
trek
i
researched
read
and
thought
about
my
main
character's
motivation
until
i
believed
my
brain
had
effectively
melted
i
fell
asleep
thinking
about
it
woke
up
thinking
about
it
had
breakfast
and
made
by
bed
thinking
about
it
and
then
sat
down
at
my
computer
and
began
to
research
again
two
things
brought
this
book
to
my
attention
i
recently
received
the
tor
winter
2011
catalog
and
the
cover
immediately
caught
my
eye
i
had
to
flip
through
the
catalog
that
instant
to
find
out
what
book
this
belonged
to
and
did
not
have
to
go
far
right
on
page
1
was
the
unremembered
by
peter
orullian
tor
obviously
has
high
hopes
for
the
series
the
second
connection
was
brandon
sanderson
mentioning
the
author
in
our
interview
with
orullian's
book
sitting
on
his
nightstand
tor
has
not
released
the
final
cover
in
color
but
here
is
a
picture
of
the
catalog
cover
which
shows
off
this
lush
image
the
eagle
eyed
amongst
you
will
notice
one
or
two
changes
twixt
script
and
screen
there
are
no
socks
or
launderettes
in
the
film
i
decided
to
keep
the
locations
simple
and
socks
really
aren
t
all
that
interesting
to
look
at
i
think
the
glove
makes
a
decent
stand
in
though
handbags
as
a
rule
tend
to
get
nicked
rather
than
lost
and
so
featuring
an
abandoned
one
would
probably
change
the
meaning
of
the
film
also
skulking
around
the
bushes
in
victoria
park
with
two
bags
full
of
toys
a
camera
and
a
tripod
and
a
handbag
might
well
have
raised
the
wrong
kind
of
eyebrows
and
or
worried
phone
calls
to
the
local
constabulary
i
think
it
was
a
sensible
decision
to
leave
it
out
i
know
people
like
this
too
many
i
can
t
spend
a
lot
of
time
with
them
because
they
the
life
out
of
me
you
are
my
heaven
when
i
was
growing
up
it
was
not
uncommon
for
mother
to
wake
me
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
say
sheri
take
your
pillow
and
go
downstairs
i
knew
what
that
meant
it
meant
a
tornado
was
coming
and
i
was
instantly
afraid
but
then
mother
would
say
sheri
everything
will
be
ok
her
words
always
calmed
me
today
decades
later
when
life
seems
overwhelming
or
frightening
i
call
mother
and
wait
for
her
to
say
everything
will
be
ok
the

we
had
a
relatively
early
night
as
we
were
back
in

room
for
2
00am
many
of
the
bars
clubs
there
are
open
until
5
or
6
in
the
morning
as
chrissie
was
not
feeling
to
good
with
a
bad
throat
it
was
nice
to
finally
meet
them
both
they
were
fun
and
i
had
a
good
night
huntsville

are
breaking
up
so
min
is
writing

a

and
giving
him
a
box
inside
the
box
is
why
they
broke
up
two
bottle

a

a

a

of

a

books
a

a

every
other
item
collected
over
the
course
of
a
giddy
intimate
heartbreaking
relationship
item
after

is
illustrated
and
accounted
for

then
the
box
like
a

have
you
ever
read
the
speech
he
made
when
he
accepted
the
nobel
prize
this
is
the
whole
speech
 
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
stand
before
you
now
because
i
never
stopped
dawdling
like
an
eight
year
old
on
a
spring
morning
on
his
way
to
school
anything
can
make
me
stop
and
look
and
wonder
and
sometimes
learn
i
am
a
very
happy
man
thank
you
 
we
both
blush
and
simon
wanders
off
to
the
bathroom
well
see
diesel
the
boxer
i
just
brought
him
home
the
day
after
christmas
steven
spanked
me
and
then
adjusted
and
grew
to
love
the
little
guy
i
don
t
want
to
bore
the
non
parent
with
details
as
to
how
it
is
done
actually
i
do
basically
you
let
the
baby
associate
the
fresh
air
on
their
privates
with
elimination
the
baby
learns
not
to
when
he
s
clothed
send
a
self
addressed
stamped
envelop
with
5
or
8
to
lewis
schaffer
that
crazy
dad
nunhead
and
i
will
email
you
how
it
s
done
two
eyes
a
thousand
expressions
policy
makers
must
address
the
country
s
rapid
population
growth
head
on
though
proactive
government
policies
such
as
the
reproductive
health
rh
bill
the
failure
to
pass
the
rh
bill
in
the
14th
congress
is
very
unfortunate
for
the
damage
that
a
rapid
population
growth
will
bring
to
this
generation
and
the
next
are
irreversible
we
simply
cannot
afford
to
have
millions
of
filipinos
go
through
the
vicious
cycle
of
high
fertility
and
poverty
high
fertility
rate
prolongs
poverty
in
households
and
poor
households
contribute
to
high
fertility
rates
i
keep
referring
to
this
scripture
because
it
says
we
have
this
treasure
this
means
it
is
already
ours
paul
was
discussing
the
glory
of
the
lord
in
this
corinthian
letter
that
the
glory
should
be
seen
in
us
the
church
is
awakening
to
the
truth
that
is
able
to
do
great
things
in
and
through
us
where
could
i
go
but
to
the
lord
according
to
barth
a
christian
account
of
dogmatics
and
ethics
both
evangelical
and
catholic
begins
with
a
particular
person
jesus
christ
and
in
his
contemporaneous
power
truth
and
love
graciously
made
available
to
us
by
the
ministry
of
the
spirit
this
too
is
chris
holmes
claim
in
his
delightful
and
eloquently
written
essay
ethics
in
the
presence
of
christ
slaying
the
dragon
of
christological
exemplarism
exemplarism
in
christian
ethics
trades
upon
principles
and
a
dead
jesus
a
jesus
who
lives
only
inasmuch
as
his
example
guides
exemplarism
is
imprisoned
by
immanence
the
idea
that
the
resources
we
need
for
good
conduct
for
living
humanly
are
present
within
the
matrix
of
our
own
experience
so
that
jesus
himself
is
called
upon
only
inasmuch
as
he
corroborates
values
and
attitudes
commensurate
with
our
account
of
what
it
means
to
be
ethical
as
a
foundation
for
christian
and
ecclesial
existence
holmes
seeks
to
draw
the
life
of
the
christian
community
into
the
orbit
of
the
presence
and
ongoing
ministry
of
christ
its
natural
environment
and
thus
to
explore
the
consequences
of
his
presence
for
ethics
and
offer
an
account
of
the
moral
landscape
of
ethics
that
is
dependent
on
its
environment
120g
plain
flour
sifted
now
you
will
understand
why
i
have
been
absent
from
the
land
of
blog
for
a
while
and
apologies
to
all
my
blog
mates
for
not
visiting
i
haven
t
done
much
traveling
around
since
returning
from
munich
but
the
upcoming
weeks
are
going
to
be
ridiculously
busy
for
me
including
a
day
tour
of
some
beautiful
castles
on
the
borders
and
trips
to
visit
friends
in
newcastle
england
munich
salzburg
then
dublin
for
thanksgiving
i
also
just
made
plans
to
visit
my
family
in
norway
for
the
christmas
holidays
which
i
couldn
t
be
more
excited
about
in
short
though
this
means
that
i
think
i
will
finally
be
busy
enough
to
be
feeling
the
pressure
in
school
i
have
three
essays
to
do
this
semester
and
a
test
coming
up
in
my
islam
class
on
halloween
the
fun
all
begins
next
week
so
hopefully
i
ll
have
some
great
stories
to
share
soon
when
you
tell
someone
that
they
need
to
do
more
research
what
you
are
essentially
saying
is
go
look
it
up
yourself
i
can
t
be
bothered
to
provide
evidence
for
my
claim
no
one
should
be
persuaded
by
an
argument
where
you
imply
that
your
opponent
is
simply
ignorant
without
attempting
to
correct
that
ignorance
and
anyone
who
argues
thusly
should
be
rightly
dismissed
as
someone
arguing
merely
to
win
an
argument
not
to
really
arrive
at
a
true
conclusion
readers
i
do
not
know
if
i
say
it
often
enough
but
i
really
am
so
thankful
for
all
of
your

need
to
remind
you
all
that
we
live
in
the
midwest
i
know
the
weather
has
been
absolutely
beautiful
but
again
we

in
the
midwest
there

probably
at
least
1
2
dozen
mornings
ahead
of
us
where
the
temperature
will
be
below
32
degrees
and
we
know
you
all
despise
this
so
although
you

absolutely
fabulous
to
look
at

2
3
more
weeks

not
meet
an
early
demise

am
working
on
a
thank

the
best
possible
way
you
can
thank
a
reader
in
the
blog
world
with
links
complete
and
utter
perfection
but
in
such
a
humble
and
understated
way
it
is
no
wonder

about

recommended
going
the

as
far
as
quality

price
are
concerned
i
don
t
recommend
this

you
want
to
buy
the

shoes
you
can
afford
go
cheaper
on

if
you
re

unfortunately
you

that

have
much

because
the

is
slowly
ambling
toward
you
with
a
deranged
lustful
hunger
in
his

you
reach
into

extract
your

you
look

startled

when
we
talk

people

that
try
to

on

we
should
not

it
can

it
can
make
a

sound
like
a

which
means
it
is
quiet
almost
like

nobody

i
may
not

my

it
is

these

are
only
a
fraction
of
the
stories
that
happened
to
kids
at
school
all
year
again
every
day
across
the
country
and
the
world
kids
still
deal
with
bullying
issues
and
many
still
don
t
go
to
school
or
even
end
their
own

there
is
still

the
fact
they

in

means
they
protect
against

among
other
things
they
are

for
a
quick
trip
outside
to
them
no
me
and
pinned
my
hair
up
and
threw
on
a
hoodie
so
my
hair
would
not
be
rained
on
and
destroyed
more
than
i
had
already
done
when
i
got
back
in
and
took
off
the
hoodie
i
noticed
i
liked
the
faux
bob
i
had
going
and
that
it
reminded
me
of
bobs
that
i
have
seen
dita

so
this
is

how
do
you
live
in
the
space
mm
apart
from
the
u
s
phenomenon
the
80s
version
of
a
folk
revival
in
my
opinion
and
some
interesting
rumblings
from
the
world
underground
that
decade
appears
today
as
a
musical
wasteland
two
questions
what
happened
to
the
promise
of
punk
and
is
there
anything
of
merit
to
come
out
of
the
1980s
that
still
resonates
bringing
ingredients
together
this
is
a
cleverly
crafted
argument
used
to
convince
those
who
have
been
burned
by
religious
organizations
that
true
christianity
is
unlike
everything
else
i
can
understand
where
this
comes
from
because
there
are
a
lot
of
bad
religions
out
there
but
this
argument
falls
short
in
establishing
a
clear
foundation
of
knowing
within
orthodoxy
according
to
the
victim
kiedis
exposed
his
and
tried
to
force
her
to
perform
oral
on
him
against
her
will
the
news
could
have
been
more
open
better
 
 
said
javier
solana
the
european
union's
top
foreign
affairs
representative
according
to
the
efe
news
service
i
am
not
sure
that
the
transition
has
begun
from
the
political
point
of
view
 
 
with
the
closure
of
the
exchange
the
dalkey
book
festival
will
find
itself
without
a
bookshop
this
year
in
june
thousands
of
tourists
will
flock
to
the
village
to
spot
their
favourite
authors
maeve
binchy
neil
jordan
declan
hughes
martina
devlin
brian
keenan
joe
o
connor
don
conroy
and
sarah
webb
all
live
within
walking
distance
of
the
shop
as
one
local
sardonically
points
out
you
can
t
throw
a
stick
down
the
main
street
without
hitting
a
writer
and
there
are
plenty
of
writers
we
d
like
to
hit
with
sticks
around
here
my
husband
also
spoke
with
his
parents
and
they
are
allowing
us
to
stay
at
their
house
over
the
summer
while
we
get
our
grown
up
lives
together
for
me
personally
i
do
not
like
fps
games
that
is
first
person
shooters
for
you
non
gamers
out
there
not
because
they
are
violent
or
graphic
but
simply
because
i
am
not
coordinated
enough
to
properly
aim
fire
and
survive
hubby
is
excellent
at
fps
games
but
i
think
that
is
because
he
is
had
actual
military
training
in
how
to
aim
and
shoot
weapons
younger
people
who
do
not
have
this
sort
of
background
experience
are
good
at
these
games
because
they
have
young
eyes
and
young
reflexes
now
mind
you
there
are
a
few
fps
games
that
i
can
play
because
their
targeting
system
seems
to
work
with
my
idiot
brain
games
like
metroid
prime
gears
of
war
and
halo
are
games
that
i
can
handle
call
of
duty
on
the
other
hand
were
it
real
life
i
would
be
dead
in
0000000001
of
a
second
i
have
to
remember
to
post
this
macaroni
salad
recipe
a
simple
one
since
it
was
a
big
hit
at
my
memorial
day
bbq
by
the
way
i
turned
50
last
week
and
wanted
to
thank
many
of
you
for
your
birthday
wishes
you
passed
my
way
i
am
in
the

now
peggy
him
wow
i
just
re
filled
his
bottle
a
few
hours
ago
the
waiter
saying
with
a
pained
expression
when
i
payed
a
13
50
pesos
bill
with
a
20
pesos
banknote
have
you
really
got
no
change
a
20
pesos
banknote
mind
you
it
s
not
like
i
wanted
to
pay
one
beer
with
a
100
pesos
banknote
which
an
american
tourist
at
the
next
table
did
and
since
he
spoke
no
spanish
the
waiter
didn
t
have
a
choice
and
coughed
up
the
change
none
at
all
i
am
so
sorry
says
i
careful
not
to
jingle
the
1
and
half
peso
coins
in
my
wallet
ah
all
right
then
he

had

along
of

a
wonderful
new
release
today
vintage
halloween
my
card
features
vintage
witch
and
she
is
colored
with
copics
i
used
pink
paisley
polka

paper
for
the

fancy

embellished

from

i

using
my

and
the

i
am
not
certain
about
the
orange
striped
paper
it
is
something
i
have
had
in
my
stash
for
a
long
time
last
week
adfd
announced
their
newest
challenge
gimme
some
texture
and
since
i
had
so
much
fun
adding
texture
to
my
project
last
week
i
got
a
little
texture
y
this
week
and
added
the
feathers
around
the
sentiment
djelibeybi
is
as
busy
as
i
remember
it
i
can
t
visit
my
uncle
or
even
risk
being
seen
i
hide
away
as
much
as
i
can
and
stay
away
from
the
main
marketplace
i
explore
the
safer
parts
of
the
city
and
stay
away
from
trouble
i
have
rented
a
tiny
room
in
an
inn
not
far
from
the
marketplace
but
before
i
did
that
i
bought
a
veil
and
put
on
my
black
robes
i
bought
a
widow
s
veil
i
should
have
been
in
eritor
now
a
blushing
bride
instead
i
am
far
from
home
in
a
widow
s
clothes
this
cultural
reality
makes
it
very
difficult
to
speak
of
authentic
christian
experience
for
we
speak
to
one
another
as
addicts
we
largely
know
experience
as
an
alcoholic
knows
alcohol
that
an
alcoholic
might
prefer
to
wine
tells
me
nothing
about
or
wine
religious
experience
tells
me
almost
nothing
about
the
church
truth
etc
it
is
the
church
truth
etc
viewed
through
the
fog
of
distorted
modern
perception
i
think
we
are
all
ready
to
get
back
to
the
grind
ava

her

while
judd

just
kidding
sort
of
which
authors
stories
did
you
enjoy
reading
as
a
child
teenager
how
do
you
think
they
compare
to
the
children
s
novels
available
today
what
do
you
think
children
of
today
want
to
read
i
haven
t
been
willing
to
face
the
truth
until
now
because
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
this
we
have
a
small
cabbage
about
17
inches
and
2
9
pounds
i
can
not
believe
how
long
she
could
possibly
be
is
i
can
not
imagine
how
she
may
feel
i
did
not
think
i
had
17
inches
in
my
short
little
area
maknae
has
decided
to
major
in
theater
and
film
and
she
will
be
debuting
soon
as
well
yesterday
she
met
with
her
director
and
will
be
sitting
down
for
dinner
with
kbs
officials
today
they
say
they
like
maknae
s
clear
image
but
i
m
a
bit
worried
because
she
doesn
t
know
anything
about
dressing
herself
up
and
is
a
bit
countrified
this
is
by
far
tayahs
1
treat
i
always
tell
myself
that
i
should
not
give
them
to
her
because
they
are
so
bad
for
her
teeth
and
tummy
but
the
look
on
her
face
when
she
knows
she
is
getting
one
is
priceless
if
you
want
to
be
popular
with
this
girl
carry
some
of
these
in
your
pocket
when
you
are
around
her
she

with
the

story
of
my
characters
now
it
was
interesting
to
begin
with
but
now
it
is
increasingly
frustrating
to
have
to
know
the
details
about
how
they
would
react
in
certain
situations
when
those
circumstances
may
never
appear
in
the
novel
i
really
just
want
to
be
able
to
get
on
with
writing
it
but
i
still
haven
t
reached
the
point
in
my
protagonist
s
story
where
her
future
behaviour
is
explained
sufficiently
for
me
to
really
communicate
any
understanding
of
it
the
hornbeam
kite
was
selected
because
it
is
the
most
forgiving
kite
for
novice
kitefliers
like
us
we
named
it
the
headless
hornbeam
because
it
has
everything
but
a
head
wings
a
tail
a
skeleton
and
without
a
head
it
has
no
idea
where
it
is
going
it
is
easy
to
put
together
all
you
have
to
do
is
tie
some
string
and
almost
anyone
can
get
the
kite
to
fly
we
ll
see
about
that
the
hornbeam
does
not
require
a
tail
but
definitely
looks
beautiful
with
long
flowing
streamers
so
we
thought
we
would
include
them
i
only
drank
wine
when
i
lost
all
of
my
weight
before
so
that
s
my
plan
right
now
wine
good
beer
liquor
bad
one
could
look
at
it
this
way
wine
is
like
eating
fruit
while
beer
and
liquor
are
like
eating
large
slices
of
bread
it
s
a
true
analogy
no
joke
if
it
wasn
t
for
the
chicken
nachos
i
made
last
night
this
has
been
a
pretty
successful
diet
week
for
me
i
think
i
am
finally
back
on
my
game
and
determined
to
get
this
weight
off
although
i
did
forget
how
annoying
and
slow
of
a
process
it
is
to
do
it
healthy
2
lbs
per
week
only
gah
diomedes
in
the
tail
of

train
i
get
sick
so
viciously
sick
that
i
am
unable
to
stand
up
in
our
two
room
schoolhouse
preferring
to
sit
on
the
stone
floor
i
sweat
and
sweat
and
sleep
high
doses
of
amoxicillin
start
to
battle
back
whatever
has
taken
over
my
system
and
i
prop
myself
up
to
play
barbies
with
two
of
the
girls
at
home
my
se
ora
takes
care
of
me
going
to
the
store
for
crackers
and
gatorade
i
miss
out
on
a
special
dinner
served
on
fridays
during
lent
and
watch
a
religious
procession
from
a
chair
in
the
living
room
by

a
m
on
sunday
i
am
fumbling
with
the
lock
on
the
door
letting
go
of
the
gigantic
iron
hook
with
a
boom
bringing
my
se
ora
and
her
sister
to
the
door
they
send
me
off
with
sleepy
blessings
and
good
wishes
and
i
go
through
the
motions
of
getting
back
to
illinois
how
hard
do
you
have
to
shake
a
family
tree
to
find
out
the
truth
about
the
past
a
child
more
possessed
of
self
esteem
is
hard
to
imagine
in
short
if
you
put
on
an
act
just
like
these
guys
show
you
you
can
make
it
look
a
lot
like
you
have
psychic
powers
and
not
just
to
people

its
such
a
nice

definitely
something
to
look
into
for
the
future
the
richest
man
on
the
ship
millionaire
john
jacob
astor
iv
founder
of
new
york
s
waldorf
astoria
hotel
went
to
the
same
watery
grave
as
the
poorest
peasant
family
who
had
hoped
to
start
a
new
life
in
america
as
women
and
children
were
being
loaded
onto
the
few
lifeboats
first
astor
had
asked
if
he
could
accompany
his
19
year
old
new
wife
madeleine
because
she
was
pregnant
and
would
particularly
need
care
but
he
was
denied
he
was
reported
by
survivors
to
have
calmly
stepped
back
tossed
his
gloves
to
his
wife
in
the
boat
lit
a
cigarette
and
watched
as
she
disappeared
into
the
night
less
than
two
hours
later
he
was
dead
all
his
millions
could
not
save
him
where
i
m
going
sometimes
we
need
the
brutal
honesty
of
such
words
it
doesn
t
mean
there
isn
t
good
advice
out
there
or
points
to
consider
rather
it
means
that
conforming
to
the
norms
is
not
something
that
i
should
do

listen
before
you
take
any
of
my
advice
you
have
to
do
one
very
important
thing
first
you
have
to
guess
who
is
super
excited
to
be
in
heat
yep
belle
and
yes
that
is
her
happy
face
cowpokette
had
to
jump
in
for
the
picture
too
belle
has
come
into
heat
and
this
time
around
we
are
going
to
breed
her
we
have
been
waiting
a
long
time
for
this
i
am
really
excited
for
little
belle
pups
the
kids
are
super
excited
too
sure
i
have
i
told
you
years
ago
sometimes
it
is
tough
to
sort
out
all
the
details
related
to
this
subject
but
i
am
positive
you
will
have
no
trouble
making
sense
of
the
information
presented
above
police
in
the
southwest
ohio
town
of
franklin
say
a
woman
handed
a
note
to
a
teller
in
a
huntington
bank
branch
friday
and
made
off
with
an
undisclosed
amount
of
money
curtis
acosta
i
said
that
it
may
end
up
being
you
favorite
part
and
i
would
not
want
to
influence
you
this
time
you
should
work

the
right
side
of

you
encase

of
your
fabric
with
the

one
of
my
friends
 
angela
had
a
workshop
for
me
a
few
months
ago
this
is
her
second
workshop
she
is
had
for
me
she
is
the
hostess
with
the

and
now
her

having
a

the
image
of
jealousy
whatever
it
might
have
been
was
an
image
that
provoked
anger
in
the
lord
what
were
these
people
thinking
at
the
time
did
they
actually
think
the
lord
could
not
see
what
it
was
they
were
doing
that
is
exactly
what
they
thought
because
the
lord
had
scraped
the
land
of
the
inhabitants
in
his
wrath
surely
the
lord
did
not
see
at
the
very
least
did
not
care
what
was
going
on
in
jerusalem
8

in
this
they
were
mistaken
in
this
that
which
they
thought
was
relatively
trivial
to
this
the
lord
took
great
exception
a
4
year
old
chicago
illinois
girl
was
shot
when
a
gun
that
was
stored
between
the
mattresses
discharged
as
she
was
jumping
on
the
bed
she
was
shot
in
the
ankle
and
rushed
to

hospital
where
she
is
listed
in

condition

fans

michael

it
is
a
little
late
for
a
new
year's
resolution
but
better
late
than
never
i
suppose
after
being
up
to
my
eyeballs
in
work
for
the
past
few
weeks
i
ve
barely
had
time
to
sit
down
and
think
about
writing
though
i
always
knew
there
was
one
specific
person
i
had
to
talk
about
eventually
oleg
babynin
bass
that
means
that
at
my
current
weight
to
get
to
a
healthy
weight
i
have
to
loose
same
amount
of
weight
as
the
weight
range
i
need
to
be
at
so
to
be
at
118
i
need
to
loose
159
if
i
want
to
be
at
159
i
have
to
loose
118
so
i
have
to
loose
a
whole
person
at
the
rate
i
m
loosing
weight
which
is
a
good
solid
weight
loss
rate
it
will
take
me
at
least
another
20
months
to
get
to
a
statistically
healthy
weight
that
is
almost
another
2
years

for

i

from

and
made

i
placed
the
circle
i
punched
where
i
wanted

and
used
my

to
secure
it

from

i
used

and

i
did
lots
of

because

dry
very

you

check

i
figured
since
it
is

almost
a
year
of

and
subsequent

change
it
is
about
time
to
switch
on
over
to
a

i
am
also
using
it
to
launch
speaking
and
writing
eventually
that
is
thank
you
for
following
my
progress
this
pregnancy
has
brought
up
many
fearful
emotions
in
me
i
think
i
m
going
to
talk
to
the
midwife
or
gp
about
it
i
have
a
feeling
it
s
related
to
fear
of
birth
but
i
keep
having
scary
dreams
and
worrying
about
joni
a
lot
more
than
usual
in
fact
i
m
going
to
go
and
check
on
her
now
since
my
last
post
something
like
29
days
have
passed
you
maybe
didn
t
miss
me
but
i
ve
missed
this
here
s
what
i
ve
been
doing
these
are
not
excuses
although
they
sound
like
good
ones
but
he
had
enough
he
continues
to
write
and
play
music
on
his
own
with
the
brothers
megas
and
to
preserve
the
oral
traditions
of
kentucky
and
iceland
he
sees
himself
as
a
creative
warrior
and
has
a
benevolent
need
to
infiltrate
the

from

with

trousers
and

i
won
some
beer
though
by
way
of
a
bet
and
this
grog
will
be
making
an
appearance
when
i
get
round
to
necking
it
it
is
pong
too
some
of
it
says
camra
says
this
is
real
ale
on
the
bottle
some
of
it
doesn
t
within

a

a
temporary
contractor
from
lincoln
knocks
around
the
office
from
time
to
time
and
we
have
been
known
to
have
a
pint
this
is
despite
his
beard
elderly
appearance
lack
of
trendy
trainers
and
fondness
for
the
variable
pongy
local
grog
that
passes
for
real
ale
around
this
part
of
oop
north
i
even
took
him
into
the
local
craft
beer
a
few
weeks
ago
to
give
him
the
choice
of
numerous
cask
and
world
beers
and
be
in
an
establishment
where
beards
were
the
norm
rather
than
unusual
that
s
the
kind
of
nice
chap
i
am
i
could
have
dragged
him
around
the
tatty
pubs
near
work
or
his
hotel
for
a
skinful
of
stella
but
i
didn
t
i
took
him
on
a
bus
to

it

defeating

what
mom
declared
forbidden
became
increasingly
random
she
decided
i
couldn
t
go
see
phantasm
because
of
the
tagline
if
this
one
doesn
t
scare
you
you
re
already
dead
yet
she
had
no
problem
dropping
me
and
two
friends
off
to
catch
dawn
of
the
dead
a
movie
so
gory
that
it
was
released
unrated
at
a
seedy
little
theater
whose
employees
never
checked
ids
if
you
ve
ever
seen
both
of
these
films
you
d
know
that
you
must
be
already
dead
because
phantasm
isn
t
all
that
scary
but
dawn
of
the
dead
is
one
of
the
most
brutal
and
vicious
movies
ever
made
even
more
perplexing
was
her
decision
to
forbid
me
from
seeing
the
gauntlet
a
fairly
minor
and
movie
in
the
clint
eastwood
canon
but
simply
something
i
had
expressed
an
interest
in
watching
yeah
that
movie
was
rated
r
but
i
d
seen
rated
r
movies
before
including
blazing
saddles
which
they
took
me
to
see
if
you
ve
never
seen
blazing
saddles
let
me
just
tell
you
that
the
liberal
use
of
the
n

would
probably
shock
modern

even
had
no
problem
with
dropping
me
off
at
the
southgate
to
allow
me
to
engage
in
the
illegal
act
of
sneaking
from
theater
to
theater
to
watch
all
the
movies
playing
at
this
four
auditorium
theater
for
the
price
of
one
ticket
during
this
time
i
remember
seeing
such
gory
movies
as
death
race
2000
where
drivers
compete
in
a
cross
country
race
and
earn
bonus
points
for
running
over
pedestrians
still
for
some
unfathomable
reason
while
sneaking
into
movies
without
paying
was
okay
the
gauntlet
was
forbidden
and
of
course
being
more
rebellious
at
the
age
of
14
i
went
and
saw
it
anyway
telling
mom
i
was
gonna
see
something
else
but
because
i
still
respected
mom
s
law
i
later
informed
her
of
my
crime
and
was
promptly
grounded
whats
out
there

it
was
a
close
battle
but
in
the
end
j
wilson
edged
out
a
win
the
win
was
based
largely
on
a
gimmick
in
which
wilson
fasted

46
days

during
lent
i
mean
that
is

is
an
accomplishment

katahane
jp302
volunteered
to
edit
my
stuff
easily
so
i
didn
t
have
to
find
any
editors
nobody
has
tattoos
anymore
i
say
they
aren
t
allowed
within
the
territory
in
hindsight
i
loved
everything
but
the
best
part
about
the
day
was
having
david
all
to
myself
all
day
and
being
able
to
just
talk
about
everything
we
never
get
the
chance
for
the
girls
were
nodding
off
in
the
back
of
the
kombi
and
popped
their
heads
up
every
now
and
then
and
got
out
when
we
stopped
somewhere
so
it
was
a
partial
rest
day
for
them
rojas
what
does
your
family
think
of
your
writing
well
this
particular
evening
the
18
year
old
was
in
need
of
a
ride
home
from
work
i
did
list
chauffeuring
as
one
of
my
sidelines
and
work
was
across
the
street
from
the
gym
this
night
the
husband
was
home
so
i
quickly
volunteered
for
the
driving
assignment
ahead
of
time
i
devilishly
plotted
to
leave
early
from
home
to
afford
me
twenty
minutes
to
worship
at
the
physical
fitness
temple
furthering
my
scheme
i
informed
the
18
year
old
that
his
chauffeur
would
be
working
out
and
he
should
walk
across
the
street
to
meet
me
at
the
gym
and
i
would
be
finished
by
then
and
drive
him
back
home
everything
went
well
i
escaped
my
responsibilities
and
was
very
proud
of
my
sneaky
tactic
to
get
a
few
moments
to
myself
having
limited
time
i
chose
the
treadmill
as
the
torture
de
jour
during
the
previous
summer
one
of
my
part
time
jobs
was
working
the
front
desk
of
a
local
gym
where
i
met
many
competitors
as
i
learned
more
about
the
bodybuilding
culture
i
became
increasingly
intrigued
by
the
competition
scene
and
gradually
adjusted
my
lifestyle
to
be
more
conducive
to
health
and
fitness
my
diet
improved
i
cut
down
on
partying
and
social
drinking
and
my
workouts
became
more
intense
we
are
proud
to
announce
that
we
have
a
brand
new
this
may
sound
idyllic
but
it
wasn
t
all
the
time
one
of
the
least
attractive
aspects
of
living
at
hampton
haze
was
that
the
older
children
had
to
walk
down
a
long
muddy
rutted
track
to
pick
up
their
school
lift
in
the
valley
and
return
the
same
way
at
night
and
on
playgroup
days
i
had
to
do
the
same
with
a
toddler
at
my
side
and
a
baby
on
my
back
we
started
hanging
out
again
lycos
dropped
the
term
tattoos
from
it
s
poll
because
the
term
was
so
popular
according
to
lycos
tattoos
rarely
drops
out
of
the
top
ten
search
terms
requested
on
the
internet
and
lycos
dropped
the
term
because
they
wanted
to
make
room
for
other
searches
but
my
friends
are
snow
birds
i
just
have
to
get
used
to
having
snow
bird
friends
i
m
a
cojean
addict
i
like
lunching
at
this
clean
little
chain
that
makes
good
soup
salads
and
pressed
sandwiches
i
like
going
by
myself
and
reading
whatever
french
fashion
or
travel
magazine
is
on
hand
and
having
my
sandwich
toast
and
taking
my
little
mid
day
break
he
laughed
but
i
only
have
eyes
for
you
remember
as
he
sat
down
he
was
treated
to
the
full
force
of
her
dazzling
smile
and
she
moved
to
snuggle
close
to
him
talk
about
falling
off
a
cliff
my
best
friend
one
of
the
loves
of
my
life
the
sweetest
and
most
caring
people
i
know
has
a
tumor
the
size
of
a
cantaloupe
however
knowing
she
is
also
falling
off
a
cliff
i
grasp
for
a
ledge
and
reach
out
to
catch
her
at
this
point
her
mom
was
in
california
on
a
vacation
enjoying
herself
which
she
never
gets
to
do
her
boyfriend
in
kentucky
3
hours
away
and
granpa
in
florida
10
hours
away
so
i
know
regardless
of
how
much
i
want
to
fall
apart
i
can
t
she
needs
me
to
be
strong
even
if
you
can
not
come
to
an
event
with
me
this
weekend
i
want
to
share
an
image
that
you
can
color
for
yourself
they
cannot
forever
live
in
never
never
land
with
rising
prices
and
collapsing
sales
there
are
many
shoes
that
will
drop
bringing
back
the
global
financial
crisis
with
a
vengeance
commodities
crash
default
by
a
euro
periphery
nation
failure
of
a
euro
bank
or
the
closure
of
bank
of
america
or
citi
all
of
these
are
likely
events
less
than
one
standard
deviation
from
the
mean
probably
all
of
them
will
happen
within
the
next
year
no
matter
what
the
triggering
event
is
that
commodities
nuclear
winter
will
happen
