that

they
should
have
five

we

we

there

here
that

we
then
look

better
for

because
it

how

the

that

idea
provided
that

then
the

plans
to
work
with

groups

optional

of
conduct
that
will
be
legally
enforceable
why
any
web
company's
legal
advisers
would
allow
it
to
agree
to
such
a
code
is
a
mystery

there
are
two
things
that

wrong
in

they

do
not

that
they

the

of

in
which
for
a
boy
like
cyril
things
do
not
easily
go
right
in
straightforward
realistic
scenes
they
show
a
boy
who
fears
he
has

persists
in

that
his

only
lost

hey
tony
last
week
a
reader
posed
a
question
as
to
whether
colt
mccoy
can
be
fairly
assessed
you
answered
that
he
could
because
a
qb
should
be
assessed
by
his
individual
skill
set
his
arm
his
ability
to
function
in
the
pocket
his
ability
to
see
the
field
and
read
defenses
his
ability
to
anticipate
routes
and
place
the
ball
where
it
needs
to
be
now
i
have
no
idea
if
colt
mccoy
is
the
answer
and
frankly
i
do
not
think
he
is
but
outside
the
arm
element
it
seems
that
every
other
aspect
of
your
skill
set
of
your
evaluation
directly
correlates
to
the
qb's
grasp
of
the
offense
how
well
one
knows
the
offense
allows
him
to
anticipate
routes
helps
him
to
know
what
to
look
for
in
a
defense
and
the
inability
to
do
either
of
those
things
results
in
someone
looking
skittish
in
the
pocket
i
believe
you

overall
it
is
fair
to

the

in

culture
since
it

north
america
in
the
eighteenth
century
through
russian
missionary
settlements
in
alaska
and
via
droves
of
immigrants
from
eastern
mediterranean
and
east
european
countries
beginning
in
the
late
nineteenth
century
indeed
it
is
often
through
ethnic
events
whether
greek
romanian
serbian
bulgarian
russian
or
arab
that
people
first
become
acquainted
with
the
orthodox
church
so
it
is
not
unusual
that
encounters
with
the
orthodox
begin
through
one's
appetite
for
baklava
or
pirogy
or
perhaps
while
attending
a
friend's
big

the
national
debt
has
grown
significantly
in
recent
years
and
it
keeps
rising
at
this
very
moment
the
way
that
people
get
into
debt
is
from
spending
and
i
believe
that
the
u
s
has
been
spending
too
much
i
am
not
very
involved
with
politics
or
with
the
government
but
from
what
i
have
seen
the
u
s
is
spending
a
great
deal
of
money
on
useless
things
i
think
it
is
time
for
major
spending
cuts
they
need
to
start
using
their
spending
money
to
repay
all
the
countries
they
have
borrowed
from
in
the
past
if
the
spending
does
not
stop
then
the
u
s
will
continue
to
go
further
in
to
debt
with
out
all
the
useless
spending
the
u
s
can
save
some
of
that
money
to
pay
off
the
debt
that
has
grown
significantly
they
can
start
to
pay
it
off
slowly
but
a
little
at
a
time
is
better
than
nothing

combining

with

stepping

talks
some

say
he

frustrated
with

reluctance

is
weary

it

the

from

with
a

for

something
she
had
never
seen

she
decided
to
try
it
for

she
drove
around
our
small
pennsylvania
town
and
found
only
one
store
that
sold
mozzarella
cheese
and
something
called
pepperoni
she
started
making
her
fresh
dough
early
in
the
day
and
kneaded
sliced
grated
chopped
and
mixed
throughout
the

a
record
so
whether
it
is
classical
western
or
indian
i
think
it
has
the
same
problem
it
is
hard
in
these
modern
days
to
have
students
who
have
the
love
and
respect
for
the
tradition
the
ball
came
right
to
me
he
said
i
was
like
 
why
is
the
ball
coming
to
me
 
but
it
was
fun
it
is
definitely
going
to
be
interesting

thank
you
nfl
there
was
a
big
court
decision
on
the
nfl
lockout
that
some
believe
will
go
a
long
way
toward
preventing
a
lockout
in
the
nba
one
of
the
challenges
for
a
show
like
grimm
is
to
keep
viewers
interested
in
the
overarching
story
about
nick
david
giuntoli
his
grimm
heritage
and
the
world
of
supernatural
creatures
grimms
are
charged
with
keeping
an
eye
on
if
the
show
gets
too
serialized
as
it
reveals
info
about
the
grimm
world
casual
viewers
may
feel
daunted
about
diving
in
but
if
they
just
keep
dropping
vague
mentions
of
grimm
stuff
more
committed
viewers
can
get
impatient
the
mccallums
are
not
the
only
father
son
coach

tandem
among

teams
in
the
men's
ncaa
tournament
regarding
the
plans
to
tax
area
residents
for
the
sewer
clean
water
plan
i
will
point
out
that
the
city
just
the
city
has
66
square
miles
of
area
a
one
inch
rain
covering
that
square
area
works
out
to
1
15
billion
gallons
of
rain
water
or
3531
acre
feet
if
i
am
doing
my
math
right
and
i
think
i
am
that
is
the
equivalent
of
a
40
acre
lake
88
feet
deep
an
acre
is
about
90
the
area
of
a
football
field
not
including
the
end
zones
of
course
the
city
is
not
entirely
non
permeable
surface
but
i
bet
its
at
least
75
that
way
and
what
if
we
get
2
or
3
inch
rain
we
sometimes
do
do
not
we
and
by
the
way
while
st
louis
county
might
be
a
lot
more
permeable
is
508
square
miles
not
including
areas
that
are
already
water
so
as
a
non
civil
engineer
i
have
a
few
simple
questions
how
is
msd
planning
to
collect
pump
store
and
treat
all
this
water
how
long
does
it
take
to
treat
water
from
a
1
inch
rain
and
what
happens
if
you
get
a
2
inch
rain
before
you
have
the
previous
rainfall
treated
or
is
this
something
like
social
security
where
i
should
just
trust
the
government
and
am
better
off
not
asking
about
the
details
or
where
my
money
is
going
makes
its
long
awaited

melissa

i

really
held

sacred
and
a
no

i
am
not
i'd
like
extend
my
apology
to
them
it
is
just
kind
of
a
bigger

i
expected
in

thought
 
i
would
like
to
make
more
money
in
less
time
 
i
was
already
on

so
my

was
already
ruined
so
i
figured
i
might
as
well
similar

it

that

inventories

not

forthcoming
payments
to
some
of

have
not

made
within
the

limit
set

there
have
been
problems
concerning

the
ironic
truth
is
that
i
suspect
there
are
countless
good
priests
and
nuns
who
favor
my
point
of
view
but
are
essentially
muzzled
by
the

the

maybe
the
fault
is

apple's
domestic
tax
bill
has
piqued
particular
curiosity
among
corporate
tax
experts
because
though
the
company
is
based
in
the
united
states
its
profits
on
paper
at
least
are
largely
foreign
while
apple
contracts
out
much
of
the
manufacturing
and
assembly
of
its
products
to
other
companies
overseas
the
majority
of
apple's
executives
product
designers
marketers
employees
research
and
development
and
retail
stores
are
in
the
united
states
tax
experts
say
it
is
therefore
reasonable
to
expect
that
most
of
apple's
profits
would
be
american
as
well
the
nation's
tax
code
is
based
on
the
concept
that
a
company
earns
income
where
value
is
created
rather
than
where
products
are
sold
and
yet
there
is
concurrence
between

the

the

because
he
is

no

about
that

is
that

anyone

will
have
to
take
the

package
a
man
who
questions
everything
he
does
why
he
is
doing
it
and
whether
he
would
not
be
happier
doing
something
else
and
one
who
is
honest
enough
not
to
commit
long

because
he
knows

that
is
why
he
sometimes
appears
so
awkward

when
talking

in

perhaps
the

important
thing
is
not
what
you

your

it
is
what
you
say
to
others
years
later
in
california
some
wineries
use
their
winemaker's
gender
as
a
sales
point
though
whether
that
is
because
of
a
belief
that
women
are
better
at
winemaking
or
merely
an
appeal
to
female
solidarity
is
hard

say

president

had
hoped
he
would
hear
from
roy
by

so
the

could
plan

for
the

on

but
as

wednesday
no
plans
had
been

he

talk
with

the

in

of
ncaa
rules
have
been
what
always
scared
ohio
state
and
most
major
programs
more
than
anything
else
ohio
state's
failure
to
monitor
or
control
those
situations
is
what
could
cause
the
program
its
greatest
problems
who
named
this
county
obviously
they
never
considered
anyone
would
ever
have
to
spell
siskiyou
with
claws
and
a
smartphone
blame
it
on
austerity
economics
the
bizarre
view
that
economic
slowdowns
result
from
excessive
debt
so
government
should
cut
spending
this
is
key
to
me
in
terms
of
equity
and
it
is
absolutely
part
of
the
mission
that
our
work
force
is
as
diverse

the
answer
hiring
is
one
of
the
biggest
challenges
a
manager
faces
people
definitely
put
their
best
foot
forward
in

therefore
you
have
to
rely
on
a
variety
of
other
factors
including
situational
responses
i
favor
the
non
traditionalist
or
the
creative
one
but
in
the
end
whether
i
am
looking
at
a
good
or
bad
resume
i
usually
follow
my
gut
i
have
been
disappointed
a
couple
of
times
but
generally
i
read
people
well
the
astonishing
reach
of
the
crct
cheating
scandal
may
be
opening
lots
of
eyes
but
many
of
us
in
academia
have
already
been
noticing
a
fundamental
and
unhealthy
change
in
how
many
people
understand
the
purpose
of
education
and
what
is
meant
by

hopefully
i
can
make

angelo

and
was
would
still
make
visits
to
colleges
during
the

he

fire
officials
said
in
florida
and
other
parts
of
the
country
bail
bond
agents
have
a
financial
stake
in
hunting
down
international
fugitives
because
they
put
up
tens
of
thousands
of
dollars
in
cash
to
guarantee
the
defendants
will
appear
in
court
for
a
guy
under
increasing
pressure
to
win
fowler
kept
his
cool
even
after
he
won
he
clenched
his
fist
and
smiled
the
only
time
he
came
close
to
getting
emotional
is
when
thinking
about
his
coach
barry
mcconnell
who
died
last
year
it
was
mcconnell
who
helped
fowler
fashion
a
homemade
swing
on
a
practice
range
in
temecula
calif
when
fowler
was
not
on
a
motorcycle
people
say
that
is
a
badge
of

the
best
current

for

is
rookie
third

mohamed
sanu
edwards
has
appeal
as
a
more
seasoned
option
but
watching
the
reunited
members
of
montrose
onstage
hagar
bassist
bill
church
and
drummer
denny
carmassi
who
also
played
in
gamma
with
able
guest
guitarist
joe
satriani
was
a
great
reminder
of
the
band's
power
and
poise
but
bibiano
himself
has
moved
past
the
restrictions
of
regional
authenticity
with
his
second
restaurant
north
portland's
mextiza
which
opened
in

he
pulled

the
victims
were
discovered
less
than
a
week
after
regina

a

for
the
national

was
found
beaten
and
strangled
in
her
home
in

gm

increasing
production
at
several
plants
in

michigan

over

next

there
should
be
plenty
of
work
for
its
larger
stamping
plants
she
said
add
a
6
inch
layer
of

or
mulch
polites
said
it
is
every
coach's
dream
to
win
a
state
title
that
is
what
you
coach
for
and
play
for
it
is
just
been
a
dynamic
last
two
years
we
got
a
taste
of
state
last
year
when
the
team
was
third
of
what
it
was
like
when
the
season
started
we
had
a
goal
to
come
back
here
and
see
if
we
could
better
ourselves
these
charges
are
in
addition
to
your
usual
monthly
charge
in
the
united
states
but
the
cost
pays
off
if
you
use
a
lot
of
data
especially
when
you
consider
that
the
standard
international
roaming
rates
for
many
western
european
countries
are
about
20
per
megabyte
according
to
grunski
of
telestial
some
web
pages
are
half
a
megabyte
so
downloading
say
five
pages
in
a
single
day
could
cost
you
50
without
a
plan
the
idea
of
the
holiday
festival
came
from
the
years
that
she
and
greg
lived
in
st
lake
city
then
in
gillette
wyo
both
of
those
cities
had
similar
holiday
festivals
for
sick
children
boyce
took
the
concept
and
brought
it
to
st
louis
my
problem
is
we
move
quicker
than
our
pilot
and
we
find
it
does
not
add
any
academic
value
he
said
there
were
other
things
too
like
shannon
not
acknowledging
when
her
name
was
called
so
shortly
after
they
got
back
from
the
beach
they
set
up
an
appointment
with
a
child
study
team
to
evaluate
shannon
they
were
living
in
minnesota
then
and
public

the
initial

claimed
the

overreacted

proponents
of

have
repeatedly
said

really

that

harris
said
at

conference
we
have
the
tools
that
we
need
to
enforce

in
this
state
to
reduce
property
crime
and
to
reduce
violent
crime
to
go
after

so
because
i
believe
in
the
power
of

i
always
have
no
matter
who
is
speaking
up
this
early
dominant
thinking
was
that
while
assad
was
no
friend
of
israel
he
remained
a
known
quantity
whose
family
had
kept
the
shared
border
quiet
for
nearly
four
decades
and
occasionally
pursued
peace
talks
with
israel
with

there

the

the

indeed
in
that
case
the

never
asserted
that
placing
the
ad
was
part
of
its
free
exercise
of
religion
in
contrast
a
pastor
speaking
from
the
pulpit
to
his
congregation
is
the
core
of
the
free

of

you
must

court
has
ever
been
confronted
with
a
constitutional
challenge
to
the
government's
restriction
on
what
a
pastor
says
from
the
pulpit
the
point
of
the
pulpit
initiative
is
to
create
a
legal
precedent
that
restores
the
right
of
pastors
to
speak
freely
from
the
pulpit
without
government
censorship
or
control

big
banks
and
their

seem
to
have
made
a
point
of
ignoring
it
with
some
privately
writing
it
off
as
no
more
than
a
badly
organized
nuisance
a
you
have
to
understand
from
microsoft's
i
think
from
the
guys
at
microsoft's
perspective
and
i
would
agree
they
have
had
some
successes
like
connect
but
they
are
clearly
behind
in
some
key
areas
that
are
clearly
the
key
battlegrounds
of
the
future
like
the
phone
and
the
tablet
and
so
they
are
coming
from
behind
there
and
so
they
have
to
do
their
best
to
catch
up
i
am
certainly
rooting
for
them
to
do
better
and
they
know
that
but
since
they
are
playing
catch
up
they
have
got
a
heck
of
a
challenge
i
try
to
give
them
my
best
advice
and
i
wish
them
the
best
but
in
technology
it
is
always
a
challenge
to
come
from
behind
sometimes
you
can
pull
it
off
and
sometimes
you
wind
up
with
a
lesser
market
share
than
if
you'd
been
earlier
into
the
game
i
could
go
on
for
hours
and
hours
about
particular
things
but
i
am
not
sure
that
this
is
what
you
want
to
talk
about
it
was
not
until
a
year
later
that
i
discovered
who
had
gone
to
michigan
with
buddy
when
i
sat
with
rosemarie
her
husband
bert
and
five
of
their
six
adult
children
to
do
a
follow
up
story
everyone
i
hoped
to
see
that
day
was
there
except
for
jimmy
the
youngest
cryptically
rosemarie
explained
that
it
would
have
been
just
too
emotional
for
him
to
be
here
rosemarie
later
confirmed
to
me
although
not
for
publication
at
the
time
that
it
was
jimmy
who
had
gone
to
michigan
with
buddy
in
the
ensuing
years
i
would
occasionally
call
rosemarie
just
to
talk
we
had
become
friends
but
i
had
become
increasingly
interested
in
jimmy
i
suspected
that
he
was
carrying
an
immense
burden
on
his
shoulders
even
if
he
had
just
gone
along
with
what
buddy
had
asked
of
him
i
asked
rosemarie
if
jimmy
would
like
to
talk
with
me
always
she
replied
he
is
just
not
ready
but
somehow
it
still
seems

detro
it

the

i
want
to
be
really
really
disciplined
about
making
budgetary
commitments
absent
knowing
what
is
happening
i
have
done
that
consistently
the
criteria
i'd
use
where
are
we
getting
our
best
r
o
i
where
are
we
getting
our
best
bang
for
the
buck
and
where
are
the
areas
with
a
high
benefit
where
we
seem
to
be
underinvesting
relative
to
similarly
situated
cities
we
are
right
now
underinvesting
in
the
arts
that
does
not
mean
in
a
down
budget
we
can
promise
to
spend
more
we
can
not
even
promise
to
spend
the
same
if
we
are
cutting
everything
but
we
should
keep
in
mind
that
we
are
not
investing
enough
the
other
thing
i'd
add
is
that
we
should
not
limit
our
thinking
to
our
ambit
of
control
we
also
need
to
consider
our
ambit
of
influence
that
the
mayor
has
the
ability
to
work
with
regional
partners
and
other
local
governments
to
help
build
the
whole
pie
the
mayor
also
has
the
ability
to
go
to
salem
the
fact
that
i
am
the
one
current
elected
official
in
this
race
and
the
only
candidate
who
has
served
in
the
legislature
will
be
an
advantage
to
leverage
other
partners

we
can

they

everything
that
the

there
may
be
some
beliefs
or
practices
that
they
do
not
follow

example

so
let
me
set
the
record
straight
my

and
always
has
been
that
consumers
do
better
when
there
is
choice
and
competition
unfortunately
in

states
75

insurance
market
is
controlled
by
five
or
fewer
companies
in
alabama
almost
90
is
controlled
by
just
one
company
without
competition
the
price
of
insurance
goes
up
and
the
quality
goes
down
and
it
makes
it
easier
for
insurance
companies
to
treat
their
customers
badly
by
cherry
picking
the
healthiest
individuals
and
trying
to
drop
the
sickest
by
overcharging
small
businesses
who
have
no

thinking

that
even
before
the

when
i
had
started
wondering
where
i
could
play
next
season
bouna
asked
them
if
they
would
be
interested
and
they
were
all
we
had
to
do

was
to

he

he

that

so
maybe
we

that

the

pay

at
a

higher
rate
than
the

individuals
but
the
primary
reason
that
many

that
more

said
somewhat
timidly
there
are
several
reasons
kids
may
not
receive
timely
effective
treatment
but
experts
say
it
boils
down
to
too
many
children
with
serious
mental
health
needs
crammed
into
a
system
staffed
by
overloaded
caseworkers
and
with
limited
capacity
and
funding
to
provide
the
right
kind
of
treatment
to
traumatized
children

the
harder
part
of
it
containers

if
you
are
not

watering
a
container
should
have
its

the
second
most
important
thing
is
more
frequent

than
the

the

more
rapidly
and
the

is
not

much

erasing
years

state
education
officials
on
wednesday
acknowledged
that
hundreds
of
thousands
of
children
had
been
misled
into
believing
they
were
proficient
in
english
and
math
when
in
fact
they
were
not
the
new
law
comes
at
a
politically
delicate
time
for
the
president
a
growing
number
of
business
leaders
describe
his
administration
as
antagonistic
to
their
interests
and
polls
show
the
american
public
increasingly
wary
of
his
policy
initiatives
as
for
knox
he
told
moscowitz
that
had
he
known
the
part
time
job
would
have
imperiled
his
full
pension
he
never
would
have
taken
it
to
those
tired
of
minnesota's
seemingly
endless
stadium
sagas
the
little
known
negotiations
between
the
saints
and
the
u
are
a
lesson
on
how
teams
appear
more
apt
to
find
ways
to
build
their
own
stadiums
than
to
save
costs
in
combining
efforts
when
the
state's
bullet
train
impresarios
unveiled
a
much
revised
plan
for
the
statewide
project
last
fall
with
campaign
style
hoopla
one
should
note
they
said
it
settled
all
of
its
outstanding
questions
and
doubts
matheny's
conclusion
is
to
trust
himself
and
those
around
him
especially
the
holdovers
from
the
unlikely
championship
team
that
required
a
23
9
rush
to
reach
the
postseason
a
1
0
win
to
secure
the
division
series
and
one
of
the
game's
most
dramatic
october
wins
to
take
down
the
texas
rangers
when
appellate
judges
decide
a
court
case
they
produce
opinions
outlining
the
judicial
precedent
and
the
reasoning
behind
their
decision
i
do
not
think
they
understand
the
sadness
and
frustration
of
many
of
our
pastors
and
parishioners
who
are
seeing
families
torn
apart
in
the
cities
and
communities
because
of
unfair
immigration
laws
rivera

we
can
understand
that
many

not

what
it

to
keep

on

our
customers
need
twice
as
much
electricity
in

summer
as
they
do
in

winter

if
you
are
going

experience
a
mechanical
problem
with
any
southern
california
power
plant
you
would
hope
that
it
would
occur
in

they

it

not

to

it

if

in

there
are
many
conservative

no
statistical

prove
that
anyone
cheated

in

was
wr

austin
in

who
wasn

rerouted
by

phillips
had
to
honor
austin
which
is
why
he
was
late
to
get
to

i
wouldn

blame
him
there
if
i
had
to
point
to
where
the
coverage
could
improve
i
d
say
rolle
could
ve
influenced
austin
a

more
and
cb
corey

could
ve

you
take
away
from
what
those

are
capable
of
doing
when
you
don

have
a
point
guard
with
them
i
think
we
can
go
that
way
for
some
short
minutes
but
they
are
more
effective
when
they
have
the
ball
reversed
to
them
and
not
initiating
the
offense
but
that
was
just
like

and
the

monday
is
empancipation
day
a
holiday
in
washington
d
c
so
it
was
surprising
to
see
on
ameren's
website
wednesday
afternoon
a
statement
that
the
utility
planned
to
place
monitoring
wells
around
all
of
its
missouri
coal

the
spanish

commercials
are
running
as
part
of
a
nine
state
25
million
advertising
effort
the
obama
team
unveiled
this
week
the
campaign
had
previously
spent
850

on
spanish
language
ads
in
the
same
three
states
to
promote
obama's
education
policies
according
to
smart

group
which
tracks
political
ad
spending
her
work
ethic
is
serious
say
what
you
will
about
ol
gretch
but
you
can
t
deny
that
the
girl
will
always
do
her
research
and
she
doesn
t
pursue
avenues
that
are
not
plausible
and
profitable
when
it
comes
to
her
pocketbook
or
gretchen
christine

she
will
first
do
no
harm
that
afternoon
the
group
strolled
old

past
a
hotel
where
novelist
ernest
hemingway
used
to
hang
out
then
visited
the

agape
promised
huge
returns
on

which
were
to
be
used
only
to
fund
specific
short
term
secured
bridge
loans
to
commercial
borrowers
or
to
make
short

to

prosecutors
said
they
say
the
defendants
knew
that
agape
and
ama
did
not
produce
or
earn
rates
of
return
that
could
support
the
exorbitant
returns
promised
to
investors
but
continued
to
solicit
money
from
investors
it
came
as
a
disappointment
but
not
a
total
surprise
when

to
make

aware

to
report
deaths

injuries
to
insurers
and
the
federal

but
some
employers
have
shirked
those
obligations
and
the
u

department
of

which
oversees
the

has
done
little
to
ensure
compliance
punish
violators

reach
out

for

he

such
a

what

not

about

1
his
size

are
not

different

i
am
not

how
much
he
can
lift
a
mediocre

requirement
of

i
believe
his
surrounding
cast
has
lifted
him
3
you
just
never
know
how
a
backup
will
react
when
he
is
elevated
to
the
starting
job
and
all
the
responsibility
falls
on
him
these
concerns
do
not
disqualify
him
in
my
opinion
but
allaying
them
would
take
a
lot
of
research
i
do
agree
if
the
browns
could
find
their
quarterback
outside
the
draft
they
could
really
make
some
hay

remarkably
close

they

nothing

for

we

bottom
of
this
she
said
we
can
not
have
a
lack
of
confidence
in
the
integrity
of
the

especially
now
as
we
are
on
the

of

the
nation's

system
every

that
richard
waits
to
be

is
another

when
millions
of
americans
are
left
unprotected
the

will
say
without
a

in

the
consumer
watchdog
agency
we
have
set
up
is
left
without
the
tools
it
needs
to
prevent
dishonest
mortgage
brokers
payday
lenders
and
debt
collectors
from
taking
advantage
of
consumers
that
is
inexcusable
it
is
wrong
and
i
refuse

take
 
no
 
for
an

creme

off

allow

to

for
at

10

20

citizen

elizabeth

suggests
an
additional
step
leave
the
flavoring
in
the
cream
cool
cover
and
store
overnight
in
the
refrigerator
before
straining
and
reheating
for
a
perfect
creme
brulee
that
is
creamy
and
delicate
it
is
imperative
to
not
over
mix
or
over
bake
it
baking
should
always
be
done
in

to
allow
even

it

this
notion
of

as
a

condition
creates
a
vivid
tension
in
the
book
where
entropy
and
forgetfulness
are
always
lapping
at
the
edges
of
the
stories
nowhere
is
this
more
prevalent
than
in
the
title
piece
at
85
pages
more
novella
than
short
story
which
revolves
around
alma
an
older
woman
in
the
middle

of
dementia
who
is
an
outpatient
in
an
experimental

clinic
in

south
africa
set
slightly
in

future
in
a
time
when
memories
can
be
recorded
on
small
digital
cartridges
and
played
back
in
all
their
sensory
lushness
the
story
addresses
both
individual
and
collective
history
since
alma's
late
husband
harold
was
an
amateur
paleontologist
her
recollection
of
him
reclaiming
something
vital
grappling
with
his
own
infinitesimal
place
in
time
pushes
against
both
her
own
gradual
disintegration
and
the
hard
sharp
fact
of
harold's
death
to
remind
us
how
ephemeral
our
grip
on
identity
really
is

anyway
how
can
it
be
such
a

thing
the
point
is
that
whether
on
the
grand
scale
or
the

it
is
not

to
build
a

that

allows
