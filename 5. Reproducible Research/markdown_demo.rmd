My First R Markdown file
===========================

This is my first R markdown file.

Here, we're going to load some data

```{r}
library(datasets)
data(airquality)
summary(airquality)
```
Let's first make a paris plot of the data.

```{r}
pairs(airquality)
```

Here's a regression model of ozone on wind, solar radiation, and temperature

```{r}
library(stats)
fit <- lm(Ozone ~ Wind + Solar.R + Temp, data=airquality)
summary(fit)
```

Here's an unordered list:

* First
