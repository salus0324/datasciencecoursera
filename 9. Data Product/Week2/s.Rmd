INSTRUCTIONS.

Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

```{r}
library(leaflet)
my_map <- leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% addMarkers(lat = 48.8667, lng = 2.33333, popup = "Paris - France")
my_map
